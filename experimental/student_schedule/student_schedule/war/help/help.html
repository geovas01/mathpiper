<P ALIGN=LEFT>The purpose of the student schedule generator is to
automatically create student schedules. It is a web application that
can be accessed with any modern web browser. The current version of
the application is configured to use the fall semester 2012 course
schedule.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>The following screenshot of the application contains
labeled arrows that explain the various parts of its user interface:</P>

<P>The application is tab based, and the leftmost tab (which is
labeled &quot;Enter Courses&quot;) contains the main user interface.
These are the steps that are followed in order to generate one or
more schedules:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Enter one or more course numbers into the text boxes that are
	in the &quot;Course Numbers&quot; section.</P>
	<LI><P>The default maximum number of schedules to generate is one. The
	maximum number of schedules to generate can be increased in the &quot;Maximum Number
	of Schedules&quot; section.</P>
	<LI><P>By default, no preferences are selected. A morning,
	afternoon, or evening preference can be selected in the
	&quot;Preferences&quot; section if desired.</P>
	<LI><P>Press the &quot;Generate Schedule&quot; button to generate the number of
	selected schedules. The schedules are placed into a new tab.</P>
</OL>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The &quot;Sections&quot; button will show and hide the numbers of
the sections that are being offered for a class. Each section number
has a check box that can be used to disable or enable its inclusion
in the schedule that is being generated.</P>
<P><BR>
<P>The &quot;Reset&quot; button will reset the application, but it will
not clear the course numbers. The &quot;Reset All&quot; button will reset
the application, and it will clear the course numbers.</P>
