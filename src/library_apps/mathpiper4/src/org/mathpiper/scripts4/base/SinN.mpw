*CMD SinN --- sine (arbitrary-precision math function)
*CALL
        SinN(x)

*DESC

This command performs the calculation of an elementary mathematical
function.  The arguments <i>must</i> be numbers.  The reason for the
postfix [N] is that the library needs to define equivalent non-numerical
functions for symbolic computations, such as [Exp], [Sin], etc.

Note that all xxxN functions accept integers as well as floating-point numbers.
The resulting values may be integers or floats.  If the mathematical result is an
exact integer, then the integer is returned.  For example, [Sqrt(25)] returns
the integer [5], and [Power(2,3)] returns the integer [8].  In such cases, the
integer result is returned even if the calculation requires more digits than set by
[BuiltinPrecisionSet].  However, when the result is mathematically not an integer,
the functions return a floating-point result which is correct only to the current precision.
