is part of a modified version of Yacas ((C) Ayal Pinkus et al.)

Currently, the licence terms of this file is simple: With this (AND ONLY THIS)
file you can do whatever you want to do. Piper-ME/XPiper evolves from
Yacas with two goals in mind: a) port it to the Java-ME API, and b) become
a complete redesign of the Yacas core engine. When these efforts are complete,
we hope we can distribute the Piper engine under GPL with linking exception.
For the time being, it is not possible to grant such an exception for 
Piper-ME/XPiper due to its reliance of the original Yacas code.
