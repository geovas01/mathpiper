/** This file contains routines for numerical evaluation of elementary functions:
 *  PowerN, ExpN, SinN etc.
 *  It is assumed that the arguments are real (not complex) floating-point or integer numbers. (The {InNumericMode()} flag does not have to be set.)
 *  The result is an exact integer or a floating-point number correct to BuiltinPrecisionGet() digits.
 *
 *  If a better optimized version of these functions is available through the kernel,
 *  then the kernel version will automatically shadow these functions.
 *  These implementations are not necessarily the best optimized versions.
