*CMD WithValue --- temporary assignment during an evaluation
*STD
*CALL
	WithValue(var, val, expr)
	WithValue({var,...}, {val,...}, expr)

*PARMS

{var} -- variable to assign to

{val} -- value to be assigned to "var"

{expr} -- expression to evaluate with "var" equal to "val"

*DESC

First, the expression "val" is assigned to the variable
"var". Then, the expression "expr" is evaluated and
returned. Finally, the assignment is reversed so that the variable
"var" has the same value as it had before {WithValue} was evaluated.

The second calling sequence assigns the first element in the list of
values to the first element in the list of variables, the second value
to the second variable, etc.

*E.G.

	In> WithValue(x, 3, x^2+y^2+1);
	Result: y^2+10;
	In> WithValue({x,y}, {3,2}, x^2+y^2+1);
	Result: 14;
