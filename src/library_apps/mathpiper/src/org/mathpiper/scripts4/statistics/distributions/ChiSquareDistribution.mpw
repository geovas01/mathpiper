*CMD ChiSquareDistribution --- Chi square distribution
*STD
*CALL
	ChiSquareDistribution(p)

*PARMS

{p} -- number, probability of an event in a single trial

*DESC
A random variable has a ChiSquare distribution with probability {p} if
it can be interpreted as an indicator of an event, where {p} is the
probability to observe the event in a single trial.

Numerical value of {p} must satisfy $0<p<1$.
