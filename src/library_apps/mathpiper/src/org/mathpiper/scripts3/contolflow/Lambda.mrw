/* Lambda was introduced as a form of pure function that can be passed on to the function Apply as a first argument.
 * The original method, passing it in as a list, had the disadvantage that the list was evaluated, which caused the
 * arguments to be evaluated too. This resulted in unwanted behaviour sometimes (expressions being prematurely evaluated
 * in the body of the pure function). The arguments to Lambda are not evaluated.
