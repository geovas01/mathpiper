*CMD Assoc --- return element stored in association list
*STD
*CALL
	Assoc(key, alist)

*PARMS

{key} -- string, key under which element is stored

{alist} -- association list to examine

*DESC

The association list "alist" is searched for an entry stored with
index "key". If such an entry is found, it is returned. Otherwise
the atom {Empty} is returned.

Association lists are represented as a list of two-entry lists. The
first element in the two-entry list is the key, the second element is
the value stored under this key.

The call {Assoc(key, alist)} can (probably more
intuitively) be accessed as {alist[key]}.

*E.G.

	In> writer := {};
	Out> {};
	In> writer["Iliad"] := "Homer";
	Out> True;
	In> writer["Henry IV"] := "Shakespeare";
	Out> True;
	In> writer["Ulysses"] := "James Joyce";
	Out> True;
	In> Assoc("Henry IV", writer);
	Out> {"Henry IV","Shakespeare"};
	In> Assoc("War and Peace", writer);
	Out> Empty;
