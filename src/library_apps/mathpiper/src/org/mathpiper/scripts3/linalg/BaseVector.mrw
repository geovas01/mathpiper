*CMD BaseVector --- base vector
*STD
*CALL
	BaseVector(k, n)

*PARMS

{k} -- index of the base vector to construct

{n} -- dimension of the vector

*DESC

This command returns the "k"-th base vector of dimension "n". This
is a vector of length "n" with all zeroes except for the "k"-th
entry, which contains a 1.

*E.G.

	In> BaseVector(2,4)
	Out> {0,1,0,0};

*SEE ZeroVector, Identity
