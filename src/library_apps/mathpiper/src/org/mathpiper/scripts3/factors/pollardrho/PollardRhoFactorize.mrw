/* This is Pollard's Rho method of factorizing, as described in
 * "Modern Computer Algebra". It is a rather fast algorithm for
 * factoring, but doesn't scale to polynomials regrettably.
 *
 * It acts 'by chance'. This is the Floyd cycle detection trick, where
 * you move x(i+1) = f(x(i)) and y(i+1) = f(f(y(i))), so the y goes twice
 * as fast as x, and for a certain i x(i) will be equal to y(i).
 *
 * "Modern Computer Algebra" reasons that if f(x) = (x^2+1) mod n for
 * the value n to be factored, then chances are good that gcd(x-y,n)
 * is a factor of n. The function x^2+1 is arbitrary, a higher order
 * polynomial could have been chosen also.
 *

/*
Warning: The Pollard Rho algorithm cannot factor some numbers, e.g. 703, and
can enter an infinite loop. This currently results in an error message: "failed to factorize".
Hopefully the TrialFactorize() step will avoid these situations by excluding
small prime factors.
This problem could also be circumvented by trying a different random initial value for x when a loop is encountered -- hopefully another initial value will not get into a loop. (currently this is not implemented)
