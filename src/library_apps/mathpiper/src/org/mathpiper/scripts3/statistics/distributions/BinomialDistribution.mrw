*CMD BinomialDistribution --- binomial distribution
*STD
*CALL
	BinomialDistribution(p,n)

*PARMS
{p} -- number, probability to observe an event in single trial

{n} -- number of trials

*DESC
Suppose we repeat a trial {n} times, the probability to observe an
event in a single trial is {p} and outcomes in all trials are mutually
independent. Then the number of trials when the event occurred
is distributed according to the binomial distribution. The probability
of that is {BinomialDistribution}{(p,n)}.

Describes the number of successes for draws with replacement.

Numerical value of {p} must satisfy $0<p<1$. Numerical value
of {n} must be a positive integer.
