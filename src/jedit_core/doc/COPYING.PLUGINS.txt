Linking MathPiperIDE statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on MathPiperIDE.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of MathPiperIDE give you
permission to link MathPiperIDE with independent modules that communicate with
MathPiperIDE solely through the plugin interface, regardless of the license
terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that
every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of
the source code of MathPiperIDE (the version of MathPiperIDE used to produce the
combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a module
which is not derived from or based on MathPiperIDE.

Note that people who make modified versions of MathPiperIDE are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.
