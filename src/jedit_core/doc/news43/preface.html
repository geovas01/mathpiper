        interesting phase of development. Left in a "prerelease" stage for about
        two years, it's had a long time to solifidy. Many of the original
        developers, including Slava Pestov, have stopped working directly on
        jEdit. Fortunately, because of the wonderful nature of open source,
        there are more and more eyeballs on this code than ever! We have
        received contributions of plugins, bugfixes, refactoring, and
        enhancements from around the globe, and our host, sourceforge.net <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=588&amp;ugn=jedit&amp;type=prdownload&amp;mode=year&amp;package_id=0" target="_top">reports</a>
        that there are on average at least a half-million downloads per year,
        and this has been true for the entire millenium.</p><p>In terms of actual releases, there may have been a slight lull
        while Slava's absense was sinking in among the other members of the
        community, but in 2006, thanks to their generous donations of time,
        effort, and coding skills, we started releasing regular prereleases
        again, fixing bugs in the core and each other's plugins, making jEdit
        more stable, coherent, and useful than ever.</p><p>The thing that really excites me is seeing members of the
        community get more actively involved in improving jedit or its plugins.
        The core is huge, and there are over 164 plugins, so there is an endless
        source of things to do. I anticipate that the trackers will always have
        many open issues, but I see many of the old ones finally being closed,
        and that is very much satisfying. I can say with complete confidence
        that 4.3 is an improvement over 4.2 in many different ways. I hope that
        after you read this document, you will think so too, and perhaps want to
        join in on the development of future versions of jEdit or its
        plugins.</p><p>I watch the tracker traffic (<code class="literal">jedit-devel</code>) and
        commit logs (in the <code class="literal">jedit-cvs</code> mailing list) with
        fascination, learning new Java tricks, or new jEdit tricks. It's quite
        satisfying to be this imtimate with code that I find I am using every
        day. I feel I am on a first-name basis with all of the active
        committers, and I've given and/or received help from every one of them.
        While it is true, there are parts of it that could be designed a little
        better, it is still the best open source editor I've seen. Thanks to the
        plugins themselves, because they are broken up into neat little
        packages, it is easier for us to isolate and fix bugs. As long as I am
        using it, I will be compelled to fix bugs that annoy me, be they in the
        core, or any of the plugins I happen to use.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="acknowledgements.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">What's New in jEdit 4.3 </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Acknowledgements</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
