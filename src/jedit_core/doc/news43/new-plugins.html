        most active development during jEdit 4.3. Some of them influenced the
        development of the jEdit core, and others are good enough to be
        incorporated into the core, but are left as separate plugins simply
        because it makes it easier for us to maintain and debug them.</p><p>Navigator, providing a navigable history, is new and improved - it
        provides the user with Eclipse-like Navigation to previous locations,
        for each TextArea of each View. It uses new 4.3 EditBus messages which
        are now available in the public API, CaretChanging and
        BufferClosing.</p><h2><a name="id372829"></a>ProjectViewer</h2><p>For managing groups of files and organizing them into trees,
        ProjectViewer is very useful. It's been under active development, and
        many bugs are fixed quickly after they are found. Its ability to filter
        its input set based on regular expressions or the contents of
        CVS/SVN/Perforce entries makes it especially handy for other plugins
        that use it, such as <span class="bold"><strong>FastOpen</strong></span> and
        <span class="bold"><strong>OpenIt</strong></span>, both of which are also recently
        updated for 4.3.</p><p>ProjectViewer is also very important for language plugins that
        want to deal with file sets. It defines a project-wide property
        specification, that makes it possible to have different settings
        depending on what the active project is.</p><h2><a name="id372861"></a>SideKicks and Language Plugins</h2><p>SideKick has been debugged and the documentation has been
        improved. Further, there is a new combobox that lets you choose your
        parser, and a new SplitPane to show you the contents of the hovered
        element. The combobox is especially important since there are multiple
        parsers that can be used on a given file, especially when you are
        working with Python, PHP, HTML, XML, or JavaScript files.</p><p>Many language-specific plugins have been redesigned to use the new
        and improved SideKick. In particular, CtagsSideKick (a replacement for
        CodeBrowser), JPyDebug, JythonInterpreter, RubyPlugin, PHPParser,
        JavaSideKick, XML, and PerlSideKick. Be sure to try them out.</p><p>In case you're looking for JavaCore, JBrowse, CodeAid,
        DotComplete, or PropertySideKick, they have all been merged (in terms of
        functionality) into the new JavaSideKick plugin.</p><p>As for HtmlSideKick, JavaScriptSideKick, and XmlIndenter, they
        have all been merged into the new XML 2 plugin, which now includes two
        parsers for CSS, one for Ecmascript, and completion popups for elements
        and attributes in XML, CSS, and HTML.</p><p>If you use many different languages, you should also try out the
        very clever ContextMenu plugin, which I am seriously thinking of adding
        to the core one of these days.</p><p><b>Ant and Xerces. </b>Previously, Apache Ant was included in AntFarm, and Apache
            Xerces was included in the XML plugin. Both of these libraries were
            broken out of their respective plugins and given their own plugin
            status. This should help avoid some of the kinds of plugin conflicts
            that arose with previous versions of XML and AntFarm.</p><p><b>Console. </b>Console has many new features, improved error parsing, and
            more keyboard shortcuts. The command execution part was rewritten.
            You should read the changelog in the Console users guide for more
            details.</p><p><b>Optional. </b>This is my first plugin, I hope you like it! It combines the
            three option panes (global, plugin and buffer) under a single tab
            pane. It saves me a lot of mouse clicks when I want to switch from
            plugin options ot shortcuts.</p><p><b>FTP. </b>The FTP plugin strongly influences the development of the
            virtual file systems of JEdit, and on occasion, bugs in one place
            require fixes in the other. FTP is being developed in lock-step with
            the core, and the most recent FTP plugin is more bug-free than
            latest version that runs on jEdit 4.2final.</p><p><b>InfoViewer. </b>This plugin uses jEdit 4.3's action overriding API to serve as
            a replacement to the HelpViewer. Since I use/work with this instead
            of the built-in HelpViewer, I do not notice or fix bugs in
            HelpViewer. Try it out - you might like it! At some point, I might
            merge this into the jEdit core, but for now, it's a separate
            plugin.</p><p><b>XSearch. </b>XSearch is a replacement for the built-in search dialogs.
            Similarly, there are new features in XSearch which have not been put
            into the core yet. XSearch has good ProjectViewer integration too -
            you can search only the files that were added to the project.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="dockable-interface.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="futureplans.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Dockable Interface </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 5. Future Plans</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
