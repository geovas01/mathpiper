        window. It is possible to have multiple views open at once, and each
        view can be split into multiple panes. jEdit remembers the state of open
        views between editing sessions.</p><p>An open file is referred to as a <em class="firstterm">buffer</em>.
        Unlike some editors where each buffer gets its own view, jEdit
        completely separates the two concepts. A buffer might be visible in
        several views, or none at all.</p><p>The drop-down list at the top of the view shows all open buffers;
        selecting one will make it visible in the view's text area. Different
        emblems are displayed next to buffer names in the list, depending the
        buffer's state; a red disk is shown for buffers with unsaved changes, a
        lock is shown for read-only buffers, and a spark is shown for new
        buffers which don't yet exist on disk.</p><p>As with most other graphical applications, there is a tool bar at
        the top of the view which provides quick access to frequently-used
        commands. Also, clicking the text area with the right mouse button
        displays a popup menu which also facilitates quick access to various
        commands. Both the tool bar and the right-click menu can be completely
        customized to suit your tastes in the
        <span><strong class="guimenu">Utilities</strong></span>&gt;<span><strong class="guimenuitem">Global
        Options</strong></span> dialog box; see <a href="global-opts.html#context-pane" title="The Context Menu Pane">the section called &#8220;The Context Menu Pane&#8221;</a>
        and <a href="global-opts.html#toolbar-pane" title="The Tool Bar Pane">the section called &#8220;The Tool Bar Pane&#8221;</a>.</p><p>Most of the view is taken up by the text area. If you've ever used
        a graphical user interface before, the text area will be instantly
        familiar. Text can be inserted simply by typing. More details on text
        insertion and deletion can be found in <a href="entering-text.html" title="Inserting and Deleting Text">the section called &#8220;Inserting and Deleting Text&#8221;</a>.</p><p>The strip on the left of the text area is called a
        <em class="firstterm">gutter</em>. The gutter displays marker and register
        locations, as well as folding arrows; it will also display line numbers
        if the <span><strong class="guimenu">View</strong></span>&gt;<span><strong class="guimenuitem">Line
        Numbers</strong></span> (shortcut: <code class="keycap">C+e C+t</code>) command is
        invoked. Note this command only takes effect until the view is closed.
        To have line numbers visible all the time, enable the appropriate
        setting in the <span><strong class="guilabel">Gutter</strong></span> pane of the
        <span><strong class="guimenu">Utilities</strong></span>&gt;<span><strong class="guimenuitem">Global
        Options</strong></span> dialog box.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="basics.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="basics.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="buffers.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 3. jEdit Basics </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Switching Buffers</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
