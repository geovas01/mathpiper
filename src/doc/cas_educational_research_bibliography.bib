	As we will demonstrate later with more examples, calculators and computers
	can be excellent mathematical
	
	compensation tools which allow less gifted students to deal with advanced
	topics.
	
	
	
	we distinguish two elementary uses of calculators or
	
	computers in teaching: automation and compensation.
	
	
	
	one can use calculators and computers as valuable teaching tools by
	looking at four topics which I think are
	
	especially important in mathematics education: trivialization, experimentation,
	visualization, and concentration.
	
	
	
	The car broadened our „moving/transportation horizons“ by trivializing
	moving up to certain distances. Similarly,
	
	the calculator broadens our „calculation horizons.“
	
	
	
	Similarly, calculators and computers (i.e. the trivialization of
	
	arithmetic, graphics, and algebra) in teaching mean that we can tackle
	
	· (more) complex problems and
	
	· (more) realistic problems.
	
	
	
	This picture of a spiral which demonstrates the path of discovery
	of (mathematical) knowledge was proposed by
	
	Bruno Buchberger.
	
	
	
	This Bourbaki
	
	system, being developed for the purpose of inner-mathematical communication,
	did without documenting the
	
	phase of experimentation, hence it consisted only of the phases of
	exactification and application.
	
	Gradually, Bourbakism lodged itself in teaching and learning. It has
	become customary to teach mathematics by
	
	deductively presenting mathematical knowledge, then asking the students
	to learn it and use/apply it to solve
	
	home work and exam problems. This is as if one would have to learn
	walking (or cycling, or dancing, ...) by
	
	studying, understanding, then applying scientific descriptions of
	the muscle motions required for walking (or
	
	cycling, or dancing, ...) – instead of learning by trial and error
	(i.e. experimentation), as it is done naturally.
	
	
	
	Hardly any mathematician on this planet could do mathematical research
	the way we demand our students to get
	
	into this subject. A student has to „locally“ build his individual
	little „house of mathematics“. A scientist does
	
	pretty much the same „globally“, i.e. on a much larger scale. For
	both the scientist and the student a substantial
	
	part of knowledge acquisition happens during the phase of experimentation.
	From this point of view it becomes
	
	understandable why so many students are at loggerheads with mathematics
	and one will demand that experimentation
	
	obtains its due position within the teaching of mathematics. Phases
	of experimentation should complete
	
	the traditional teaching methods – not substitute them! We do not
	advocate the return to Egyptian experimental
	
	mathematics. Simply, mathematics teaching should go through all three
	phases of the above spiral.
	
	
	
	However, it is understandable that, within the framework of today‘s
	curricula, there was hardly any experimentation
	
	in the sense of Buchberger’s creativity spiral. This kind of experimentation,
	performed with paper and
	
	pencil, is both timeconsuming and errorprone. Within the time available
	at school, students could produce only a
	
	very small number of examples for the purpose of observing and discovering,
	and a hefty portion of these examexample

	Mathematics

	ples could be faulty due to calculation errors. There is nothing you
	can observe from only a few, partly wrong
	
	examples! From now on algebraic calculators enable students to experiment
	within almost all topics treated in
	
	mathematics teaching. There is no limit to the number of examples
	the student can do and the electronic assistant
	
	guarantees the properness of the results.
	
	
	
	Talking about an assistant: Records indicate that great mathematicians
	
	such as Carl Friedrich Gauss employed herds of human „calculators“
	without which they would not have made
	
	most of their famous findings.
	
	
	
	Consider
	
	a less gifted student and compare the learning effect when the student
	has to draw the graph manually with
	
	when the student is allowed to use a calculator: A manually produced
	graph would take too much time and most
	
	probably it would have only a vague resemblance with the true graph.
	(„What can you observe from wrong
	
	examples?“) Only with the help of the calculator this student has
	a realistic chance to memo rize the correspondance
	
	between the expression and the (proper!) graph. Producing graphs with
	paper and pencil certainly continues
	
	to be a worthwhile activity which is important in learning to understand
	the correspondance between algebraic
	
	and graphic representations. However, immediacy and correctness are
	such crucial psycho logical factors, that
	
	providing less giftes students with an appropriate tool (such as a
	graphic calculator) is a pedagogical duty.
	
	
	
	In the above subsection on concentration we compared teaching mathematics
	with building a house. In the language
	
	of this metaphor the above mentioned problem of mathematics education
	translates into the problem of
	
	building a new storey on top of an incomplete storey. For example,
	as soon as we start building the storey of
	
	„choosing equivalence transformations“, the storey of „simplifying“
	is still incomplete for many of our students.
	
	In mathematics teaching at school we simply don’t have enough time
	for waiting until all students have completed
	
	all previous storeys. The curriculum forces the teacher to continue
	with the next topic, independent of the
	
	progress of individual students. So, it remains to ask how a student
	can build a storey on top of an incomplete
	
	one. The above example demonstrates how I suggest to answer this question:
	While the student learns the higherlevel
	
	skill, the calculator solves all subproblems that require the lower-level
	skill. Using the language of the
	
	metaphor, the calculator is a scaffolding above the incomplete storey.
	
	
	
	In the above exercise, the algebraic calculator is a scaffolding that
	compensates any weakness with the lowerlevel
	
	skills, hence it helps avoiding mistakes. In case the final teaching
	goal is to have students be able to solve
	
	systems of equations (or perform any other skill B) manually (because,
	for example, the students are assessed
	
	centrally at the end of the school year), then it is recommended to
	perform the following three steps. The first
	
	step is teaching and practising skill A. The second step is teaching
	and practising skill B, while using the algebraic
	
	calculator to solve all those subproblems that require s kill A (i.e.
	the student can fully concentrate on
	
	learning skill B.) The third step is to combine skills A and B with
	no support from technology.
	
	This is one of many conceivable methods of using algebraic calculators
	and computers as pedagogical tools
	
	
	
	The temporary use of technology can help to break down the learning
	process into smaller, easier „digestible“
	
	pieces. For less gifted students, who could not swallow the „big pieces“
	we offered them so far, this may be the
	
	only way of mastering these learning steps. They find it easier to
	keep track of the steps without getting lost (or
	
	screwed up) in details such as simplification. When comparing the
	teaching of mathematics with building a
	
	house, the use of technology compares with using a scaffolding.
	
	
	
	The scaffolding method is any pedagogically justified sequence of
	using and not using technology for trivialization,
	
	experimentation, visualization, or concentration either in the sense
	of automation or compensation.
	
	
	
	I believe that the two central goals in mathematics education should
	be to train the students in the two disciplines
	
	intellectual sports and problem solving.
	
	
	
	In medicine there exist definitions of what a „healthy“ person must
	be able to do physically. After a heart attack,
	
	for example, a patient must be able to walk a certain distance and
	to take the stairs a certain number of levels
	
	before he is considered cured. We need something similar for our intellectual
	capabilities, i.e. a definition of
	
	what an „intellectually healthy“ person must be able to do in terms
	of, for example, memorization, or mental
	
	calculations.
	
	For what concerns our physical capabilities, we introduced the school
	subject „sports“ in order to fight a further
	
	deterioration. We need to take similar steps regarding our intellectual
	capabilities, e.g. we need the introduction
	
	of a school subject „intellectual sports“. I believe that this should
	be one of the goals of mathematics education.
	
	
	
	In mathematics I consider problem solving to be the ability to use
	mathematical tools for solving real world
	
	technical problems.
	
	
	
	Today, problem solving is treated at school only half-heartedly. The
	main emphasis is put on the second step,
	
	calculation, and its execution with paper and pencil. Therefore, most
	problem solving exercises turn into exercises
	
	for practising calculation skills. Since translation hardly is taught
	explicitely, it is understandable that a
	
	majority of students don’t develop this ability, hence they are afraid
	of this type of exercises. As a consequence,
	
	most students believe that such exercises are only for the most ingenious
	among them.
	
	By employing technology as widely as possible, we can dedicate enough
	time to teach the choosing of models
	
	and the translating. Once these skills are taught explicitely, more
	students will appreciate and master them.
	
	
	
	Curricula should aim at educating students in the disciplines intellectual
	sports and problem solving.
	
	The goal of intellectual sports are intellectual fitness and health
	as has been described in detail earlier. It goes
	
	without saying that technology should only be an training tool („mathematical
	home trainer“) and must not be
	
	used when testing these abilities.
	
	The goal of problem solving is the ability of using given tools for
	solving given problems. It goes without saying
	
	that the use of technology should be highly welcome here.
	
	Once again I draw a parallel using the initial comparision of mathematics
	with moving/transportation. Problem
	
	solving compares with an actual desire of moving from A to B (or transporting
	something from A to B). Only
	
	the reaching of B counts. It is less important (maybe even unimportant)
	how we got there. Intellectual sports
	
	compares with a jogger who runs along a track in order to gain physical
	fitness. Only the jogging counts. It is
	
	unimportant where the track is or where it leads to. Transferred to
	mathematics this means the following: In
	
	problem solving only the result counts. It is irrelevant how the calculations
	were performed. In intellectual sports
	
	only the performing of the calculation counts, while the result is
	unimportant.
	
	
	
	The above yields a very simple rule for assessment: When assessing
	intellectual fitness, no tool is allowed, not
	
	even a simple four-function calculator. When assessing problem solving,
	all tools are allowed (better: solicited),
	
	in particular graphic or algebraic calculators. In case this splitting
	is not managable within an exam, one should
	
	assess the two disciplines at different times.
	
	
	
	In the end technology should play a secondary role in both disciplines.
	In intellectual sports the goal is a
	
	performance with a minimum of tools. In problem solving the goal is
	to learn all those skills and abilities that are
	
	needed for problem solving and that are not supported by any technology.
	A good mathematics education will
	
	use a calculator or computer like language education uses dictionaries.
	
	
	
	The Austrian and other investigations showed the following: If technology
	is used properly, it leads to
	
	· more efficient teaching and learning,
	
	· more inpedendent productive student activity,
	
	· more student creativity,
	
	· an increased importance of the teacher.
	
	The teacher has the duty to accompany and direct the students at their
	partly individual voyage of discovery
	
	through the world of mathematics. Consequently the key to the success
	in teaching mathematics is good teacher
	
	training. Not technology changes teaching, but technology is a catalyst
	for teachers to change},

  review = {In 1996 a review of the literature on the use of CAS in undergraduate
	
	mathematics suggested that not only could CAS be used to do mathematics
	
	but it might also help students leam quickly and increase their understanding
	
	of mathematical concepts. Heid (1988) reported that for an introductory
	
	calculus course a group taught using CAS to presen: and explore concepts
	
	produced sinmlar results to a comparison group on a skills test and
	showed
	
	greater understanding of concepts and the ability to use different
	representations.
	
	Palmniter ( 199 1 ) reported that an experimental CGS group covered
	the
	
	same course as a traditional group with fewer hours teaching and that
	these
	
	students outperformed the traditional group on both concepEual and
	computational
	
	exams. Day (1.993) encouraged us that "the power and flexibility of
	
	technology can help change the focus of school algebra from students
	becoming
	
	mediocre manipulators to their becoming accomplished analysts" (p.
	30).
	
	Previous experience (Reid. 1988, Palmniter, 1991, Mayes, 1993,
	
	Llorens-Fuster, 1995, Heid & Zbiek, 1995, Bennett. 1995, Taylor, 1995:
	
	Hirschorn &Thompson, 1996) suggested that a CAS could facilitate student's
	
	learning by:
	
	* exposure to lots of examples and nonexarnples in a short space of
	time;
	
	* encouraging detailed obsen'ation and conjectures;
	
	development of rules by induction;
	
	* exposure to multiple representations, graphical, numeric and algebraic;
	
	* improving attitudes and class attendance; and
	
	* reducing the anxiety of "making mnistakes.
	
	
	
	Initially CAS were used for demonstrating ideas in lectures by aiding
	
	visualisation and in 1992 laboratory sessions were introduced. These
	sessions
	
	were based on worksheets which helned students learn to use DERIVE
	
	and required them to use the CAS in solving extended problems and
	
	harder examples (Yearwood & Glover, 1995). Until 1997 students had
	three
	
	hours of lectures and tutorials for traditional mathematics and one
	hour in a
	
	computer laboratory. Assessment was undertaken in separate parts both
	
	with and without CAS. In 1997 the use of CAS was broadened. Students
	
	were encouraged to see it as a tool to help them learn and understand
	mathematics
	
	not just assist them with difficult problems. To facilitate this,
	CAS
	
	was made available for all classes and all assessment tasks.
	
	This article examines the experience of the transition years, 1995-1998,
	
	and looks at the changes required in organisation and teaching. In
	1995/96
	
	students learned mathematics "by hand" and learned to use DERIVE for
	
	mathematics. In 1997/98 students also used DERIVE to help them learn
	
	mathematics. A study was undertaken to monitor student's responses
	to the
	
	changes in teaching and assessment. Data was collected using surveys,
	interviews,
	
	and anecdotes (Table 1).
	
	
	
	It has been often stated (Ramsden, 1992) that assessment drives students'
	
	learning, and that students will value and concentrate on those aspects
	
	of a course that they know will be assessed. Amold (1 995k) observed
	
	that students who were not allowed to use CAS in their examinations
	used it
	
	as little as possible in their learning exercises. If CAS is to be
	taken seriously
	
	as a mathematics learning tool then students need to have access to
	it for
	
	assessment tasks.
	
	
	
	A key change in exarmination questions was the extension of assessment
	
	from students' recall of facts and by-hand skills to questions that
	require
	
	students to interpret and explain their answers.
	
	
	
	Lecturers in 1997/98 also commented that student's conversations in
	
	these laboratory sessions tended to focus on the mathematics problems.
	
	They shared conjectures about patterns in algebra and discussed key
	features
	
	of graphs. Lecturers commented that this contrasted with students'
	behaviour
	
	in the more traditional "pen and paper" tutorials where the stuldents
	
	either worked in silence or discussed unrelated topics.
	
	
	
	Rather than
	
	seeing the abilitv to use DERIVE as an end in itself, students saw
	it as a tool
	
	for doing and exploring mathematics.
	
	
	
	As CAS becomes more accessible in both interface and cost, it inevitably
	
	impacts on both what is valued in mathematics and how this is taught.
	
	
	
	What does it mean to
	
	be able to do mathematics.. understand mnathematics when the CAS can
	do
	
	the rouLtines and get the right answer?},
