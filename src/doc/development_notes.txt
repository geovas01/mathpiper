Development notes.

:indentSize=4:lineSeparator=\n:noTabs=false:tabSize=4:folding=explicit:collapseFolds=0:wordWrap=soft:

{{{====To Do
- Add default fold which will set default fold properties like output="output".
+ Add dependency code for geogebra, errorlist, etc.
- Add output property for folds.
+ Add shortcut and button for inserting a fold into a .mws file.
+ Allow properties to not use quotes around the value.
+ Change Geogebra to GeoGebra globally.
- Change file format from .mrn to .mathrider (maybe leave .mrn to make tabs shorter.) (Actually, perhaps .mr or .mar would be better.).
+ Check if Yacas remembers variable values between sessions.
+ Check to make sure that at least Sun's Java 5 is installed.
+ Do better syntax checking on fold properties.
+ Have Yacas console use the text area font size (like svn does).
- Include Yacas documentation in JYacas plugin.
+ Make the JYacas console the default console application.
+ Obtain line number when JYacas encounters an error when executing a file.
+ Perhaps run JYacas in its own thread so that the application does not lock up during execution.
+ Register a single error source instance and make it accessible to the <shift><click> macro.
+ Why doesn't =, :=, etc. highlight?
+ Macro which brings up checkbox for all properties for a % fold command when it is shift clicked.
+ Macro: right click menu which allows inserting of fold template.
+ Place MathRider variables in standard jEdit beanshell environment.
+ Use the ContextMenu plugin to create a special popup menu for .mws files.
+ Add dock sidekick plugin to the right side of the screen and have it show outline of .mws files.
+ Use ShortCutSaver plugin for .mws shortcut keys (maybe like <shift><enter>).
+ Study TextAutocomplete plugin for ideas on keyword autocompletion.
- Fix problem where %output folds don't cause extra %ends but %error folds do.
+ Figure out a way to output the result of the last expression in a fold without Writing or Echoing.
+ Make fold types a property for use by Shift_Enter.bsh file, mode file, and the configurable fold handler plugin.
+ Allow help on a Yacas function to be brought up by ???ing on it (including the source code of the function).
+ Check to see if we can remove the C: stripping code from Shift_Enter.bsh with this: file:///C:/ted/download/yacas_manual/refchapter26.html#c26". (Doesn't work, must fix bug in Yacas itself).
+ Allow multiple output folds to be generated.  For example, both %latex and normal %output.
+ Add autoexecute parameter which automatically executes an output fold.
- Allow source code for any function in the standard library to be brought up in the editor (like Sage ?? command).
+ Allow font size to be adjusted for any TextArea.
+ Allow Yacas Docs JEditorPane to be scrolled with the up and down arrows.
+ Allow Yacas Docs JEditorPane to save bookmarks.
+ Show "breadcrumb trail" at the top of the Yacas Docs window.
+ Perhaps dynamically set the mode of .mws files by what kind of fold the cursor is placed in.
+ Check MathAdd and other functions not being looked up in Yacas Docs.
+ Allow folds to call other folds.
+ Allow GUI components to call folds.
+ Add uasm65 mode.
+ Fold output property could specify multiple properties by entering normal|latex.
 Allow YacasDocs to show either the docs for a core function or its source code.  (Open source code in a buffer).
- Make indent level of output one more level than the indent level of the fold.
+ Fix problem of Yacas not being able to find file on other drive othern than the current drive.
+ Check toc.xml error in help.
+ Allow YacasDocs to have tabbed viewing area.  Allow right click on hyperlink to have option of opening in a new tab.
- Add quotes to mode.
- Add usage information to the JYacas console.
- Change // and /**/ to same color in mode.
- Fix GeoGebra docking menu overwriting problem.
- Make a JYacas mode file.
- Perhaps add properties to a fold like manipulate=true:output=latex.
- Tag folds by type, for example %yacas, %latex, %uasm65, %equation.

Initial release:
+ Documentation: Main mathrider, all plugins.
+ Add GPL statement to all source code files.
+ Check GPL statements on plugins.

{{{Fold types (Make sure to add fold types in Shift_Enter.bsh file, mode file and configurable fold handler plugin.)
+ yacas - Executes yacas code.
+ cas - Executes code using the default cas system.
+ manipulate - Allows user to manipulate an equation or inequality.
+ latex - Displays latex code using the default latex viewer.
+ geogebra - Sends geogebra commands to geogebra.
+ plot2d - Plots functions using the default 2d plotting program.
+ jmol - Sends jmol commands to jmol.
+ plot3d - Plots functions using the default 3d plotting program.
+ spreadsheet - Sends spreadsheet data to the default spreadsheet program.
+ beanshell - Sends code to beanshell.  Useful for creating GUIs, text scripts, etc.

	I'm writing a small tutorial on CAS for hobby electronics.
	However, when I tried to solve a transcendental equation numerically, I
	encountered a Problem:
	
	RL:=1
	
	equ:=10e3*(2.68e-9*(Exp((9.75*Ln(IC/(7e-18*((4500-(68*IC+25500*IC+375*IC*RL))
	/23625+1)))+25500*IC+68*IC)/0.3588e2)-1)+IC/375)+(2*(9.75*Ln(IC
	/(7e-18*((4500-(68*IC+25500*IC+375*IC*RL))/23625+1)))
	+25500*IC+68*IC))/750-12==0
	
	Newton(equ[1], IC, 0.01, 1e-6) simply returns 'Undefined', but the equation has
	a (real) solution at 0.0051042 which can be found with Octave, for example.
	
	Additionally I don't understand why
	 Re(1/(I*w*c))
	gives
	 1/(Complex(0,1)*w*c)
	as result, but the correct result is simply 0. I thought, maybe yacas assumes
	that w and c may be complex, but
	 Re(1/(I*Re(w*c)))
	doesn't work, too.
	
	Well, I thought maybe you want to know that.

+ The Load command kills the contents of % which makes it impossible to access the
	result of the last evaluation.
+ Implement symbolic arithmetic so that m := 144 == 20 * a + b; n := 136 == 10 * a + b;c := m-n; works.

Why is this list missing commas and curly braces?

{{{===="Notebook" thoughts.

One could create a html-based notebook like the Sage notebook but perhaps it would be better to create a 100% Applet-based notebook which would use a layout manager to lay components out in a vertical fasion.  The mathrider application can generate online notebooks which is similar to the way that GeoGebra generates online viewers.
