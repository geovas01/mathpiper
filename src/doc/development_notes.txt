{{{====To Do
+ Change Geogebra to GeoGebra globally.
- Fix GeoGebra docking menu overwriting problem.
- Add usage information to the JYacas console.
+ Make the JYacas console the default console application.
- Make a JYacas mode file.
+ Obtain line number when JYacas encounters an error when executing a file.
+ Include Yacas documentation in JYacas plugin.
+ Perhaps run JYacas in its own thread so that the application does not lock up during execution.
+ Check to make sure that at least Sun's Java 5 is installed.
+ Change file format from .mrn to .mathrider (maybe leave .mrn to make tabs shorter.) (Actually, perhaps .mr or .mar would be better.).
+ Add shortcut and button for inserting a fold into a .mrn file.
- Add quotes to mode.
+ Change // and /**/ to same color in mode.
+ Tag folds by type, for example %yacas, %latex, %uasm65, %equation.
+ Perhaps add properties to a fold like manipulate=true:output=latex.
+ Have Yacas console use the text area font size (like svn does).
+ Check if Yacas remembers variable values between sessions.
+ IsPrime's output is not shown.
+ Copy default type into empty {{{ }}} folds.

}}}

{{{Fold types
+ yacas - Executes yacas code.
+ cas - Executes code using the default cas system.
+ manipulate - Allows user to manipulate an equation or inequality.
+ latex - Displays latex code using the default latex viewer.
+ geogebra - Sends geogebra commands to geogebra.
+ plot2d - Plots functions using the default 2d plotting program.
+ jmol - Sends jmol commands to jmol.
+ plot3d - Plots functions using the default 3d plotting program.
+ spreadsheet - Sends spreadsheet data to the default spreadsheet program.
+ beanshell - Sends code to beanshell.  Useful for creating GUIs, text scripts, etc.
+ html.
+ sql.

{{{Yacas bugs.
+Why do some commands return True: while others return True with no : (Like Function);
+What is FWatom in the factors.rep repository?
}}}

{{{Yacas enhancements.
+Multivariate factoring.

{{{====jedit_gui.props
insert-newline-indent.shortcut=  //Turn off auto indent after newline.
}}}


{{{====How to stop a calculation.

  public void StopCurrentCalculation()
  {
    yacas.env.iEvalDepth = yacas.env.iMaxEvalDepth+100;
  }
}}}

{{{====Should the Plot2D and Plot3D returned data interfaces be unified?
}}}


{{{====Determining if an error was encountered.

String response = yacas.Evaluate(expression);

if (yacas.iError != null)
{
  AddLinesStatic(48,"Error> ",yacas.iError);
}
}}}


{{{===="Notebook" thoughts.

One could create a html-based notebook like the Sage notebook but perhaps it would be better to create a 100% Applet-based notebook which would use a layout manager to lay components out in a vertical fasion.  The mathrider application can generate online notebooks which is similar to the way that GeoGebra generates online viewers.
}}}

{{{====Calculator thoughts.
- Include multiple calculator plugins and create a way for them to interoperate with JYacas.
