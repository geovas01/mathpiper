INSTALLATION AND OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Unzip the archive into a directory of your choice.

2) Open a shell, change to the sageide/sageserver directory, and execute the 
   sageserver.py program using SAGE.  

3) Open a separate shell, change to the sageide directory, and execute the 
   'run.bat' (for Windows) script or the 'run.sh' (for Linux) script to launch 
   SAGEIDE.  Note: Work on deploying SAGEIDE to the MAC is on the todo list.
   
4) Execute the example.sage program using the instructions that are in the 
   comments at the top of this file.  The first time you execute a SAGE program 
   in SAGEIDE you will have to wait a little while while the Jython environment 
   compiles itself.  After that, execution will be much quicker.
   
5) If you have OpenGL installed on your machine, switch to the file called 
   GearBox.py and follow the instructions at the top of the file in order to 
   execute it.  A Java3D demonstration program will be launnched in a separate 
   window.
