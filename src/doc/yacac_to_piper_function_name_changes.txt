//Proposed function name changes: 

//Make RuleBase names read more like the name Database does.
RuleBase -> Rulebase
MacroRuleBase -> MacroRulebase
RuleBaseArgList -> RulebaseArgs
MacroRuleBase  -> MacroRulebase
MacroRuleBaseListed  -> MacroRulebaseListed

//In general, make function names read like Object.method. For example,
FindFile -> FileFind
FindFunction -> FunctionFind
ConcatStrings -> StringsConcat
Use -> ScriptUse
Load -> ScriptLoad
etc.


//In general, spell function names out completely.
RulebaseArgs -> RulebaseArguments
EquRight -> EquationRight
etc.


//Misc.
Echo -> Print
== -> =, = -> ==  //This is to make == uniform with !=, >=, <=, etc.  This change also makes interoperating with geogebra and maxima easier.
D -> Derive //Because syntax highlighting just "D" is too general.
Change a number of bodied operators like D and Integrate to non-bodied operators to make function calls uniform.  For example, Integrate is bodied but WithValue is not.
Listify -> FunctionToList
UnList -> ListToFunction
FindRealRoots -> RealRootsFind
NumRealRoots -> RealRootsNum
Clear -> Unbind (or perhaps IsAssigned and Unassign?)
