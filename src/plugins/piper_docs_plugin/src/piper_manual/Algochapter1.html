<h2>
<hr>1.1 Sparse representations
</h2>
<h3>
<hr>The sparse tree data structure
</h3>
Piper has a sparse tree object for use as a storage for storing 
(key,value) pairs for which the following properties hold:


<p>
<ul><li>(key, value1) + (key, value2) = (key, value1+value2)
</li></ul>

<p>
In addition, for multiplication the following rule is obeyed:


<p>
<ul><li>(key1, value1) * (key2, value2) = (key1+key2, value1*value2)
</li></ul>

<p>
The last is optional. For multivariate polynomials (described elsewhere)
both hold, but for matrices, only the addition property holds.
The function <b><tt>MultiplyAddSparseTrees</tt></b> (described below) should not
be used in these cases.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Internal structure
</h3>
A key is defined to be a list of integer numbers (<b>n[1]</b>, ..., <b>n[m]</b>).
Thus for a two-dimensional key, one item in the sparse tree database
could be reflected as the (key,value) pair <b><tt> {{1,2},3} </tt></b>, which states that 
element <b><tt>(1,2)</tt></b> has value <b><tt>3</tt></b>. (Note: this is not the way it is stored
in the database!).


<p>
The storage is recursive. The sparse tree begins with a list of 
objects <b><tt> {n1,tree1} </tt></b> for values of <b><tt>n1</tt></b> for the first item in the
key. The <b><tt>tree1</tt></b> part then contains a sub-tree for all the items
in the database for which the value of the first item in the key is <b><tt>n1</tt></b>.


<p>
The above single element could be created with 


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; r:=CreateSparseTree({1,2},3)
Out&gt; {{1,{{2,3}}}};
</pre></tr>
</table>
<b><tt>CreateSparseTree</tt></b> makes a database with exactly one item.
Items can now be obtained from the sparse tree with <b><tt>SparseTreeGet</tt></b>.


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; SparseTreeGet({1,2},r)
Out&gt; 3;
In&gt; SparseTreeGet({1,3},r)
Out&gt; 0;
</pre></tr>
</table>
And values can also be set or changed:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; SparseTreeSet({1,2},r,Current+5)
Out&gt; 8;
In&gt; r
Out&gt; {{1,{{2,8}}}};
In&gt; SparseTreeSet({1,3},r,Current+5)
Out&gt; 5;
In&gt; r
Out&gt; {{1,{{3,5},{2,8}}}};
</pre></tr>
</table>
The variable <b><tt>Current</tt></b> represents the current value, and can
be used to determine the new value. <b><tt>SparseTreeSet</tt></b> destructively
modifies the original, and returns the new value. If the key
pair was not found, it is added to the tree.


<p>
The sparse tree can be traversed, one element at a time, with 
<b><tt>SparseTreeScan</tt></b>:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; SparseTreeScan(Hold({{k,v},Echo({k,v})}),2,r)
{1,3} 5 
{1,2} 8 
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
An example of the use of this function could be multiplying a
sparse matrix with a sparse vector, where the entire matrix
can be scanned with <b><tt>SparseTreeScan</tt></b>, and each non-zero matrix element
<b>A[i][j]</b> can then be multiplied with a vector element <b>v[j]</b>,
and the result added to a sparse vector <b>w[i]</b>, using the 
<b><tt>SparseTreeGet</tt></b> and <b><tt>SparseTreeSet</tt></b> functions.
Multiplying two sparse matrices would require two nested calls
to <b><tt>SparseTreeScan</tt></b> to multiply every item from one matrix with
an element from the other, and add it to the appropriate element 
in the resulting sparse matrix.


<p>
When the matrix elements <b>A[i][j]</b> are defined by a function
<b>f(i,j)</b> (which can be considered a dense representation), 
and it needs to be multiplied with a sparse vector <b>v[j]</b>,
it is better to iterate over the sparse vector <b>v[j]</b>.
Representation defines the most efficient algorithm to use
in this case.


<p>
The API to sparse trees is:
<ul><li></li><b><tt>CreateSparseTree(coefs,fact)</tt></b> - 
Create a sparse tree with one monomial, where 'coefs' is the 
key, and 'fact' the value. 'coefs' should be a list of integers.
<li></li><b><tt>SparseTreeMap(op,depth,tree)</tt></b> - 
Walk over the sparse tree, one element at a time, and apply the 
function "op" on the arguments (key,value). The 'value' in the
tree is replaced by the value returned by the <b><tt>op</tt></b> function. 'depth'
signifies the dimension of the tree (number of indices in the key).
<li></li><b><tt>SparseTreeScan(op,depth,tree)</tt></b> - 
Same as SparseTreeMap, but without changing elements.
<li></li><b><tt>AddSparseTrees(depth,x,y)</tt></b>, <b><tt>MultiplyAddSparseTrees(depth,x,y,coefs,fact)</tt></b> -
Add sparse tree 'y' to sparse tree 'x', destructively.
in the <b><tt>MultiplyAdd</tt></b> case, the monomials are treated as 
if they were multiplied by a monomial with coefficients 
with the (key,value) pair (coefs,fact). 'depth'
signifies the dimension of the tree (number of indices in the key).
<li></li><b><tt>SparseTreeGet(key,tree)</tt></b> - 
return value stored for key in the tree.
<li></li><b><tt>SparseTreeSet(key,tree,newvalue)</tt></b> - 
change the value stored for the key to newvalue. If the key was not found then
<b><tt>newvalue</tt></b> is stored as a new item. The variable <b><tt>Current</tt></b> is set to the
old value (or zero if the key didn't exist in the tree) before evaluating
<b><tt>newvalue</tt></b>. 
</ul>

<h2>
<hr>1.2 Implementation of multivariate polynomials
</h2>
This section describes the implementation of multivariate
polynomials in Piper.


<p>
Concepts and ideas are taken from the books [Davenport <i>et al.</i> 1989] and [von zur Gathen <i>et al.</i> 1999].


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Definitions
</h3>
The following definitions define multivariate polynomials,
and the functions defined on them that are of interest
for using such multivariates.


<p>
A <i>term</i> is an object which can be written as 


<p>

<p><center><b>c*x[1]^n[1]*x[2]^n[2]*...*x[m]^n[m] </b></center></p>

for <b>m</b> variables (<b> x[1]</b>, ..., <b>x[m]</b>). The numbers <b>n[m]</b>
are integers. <b>c</b> is called a <i>coefficient</i>, and 
<b> x[1]^n[1]*x[2]^n[2]*...*x[m]^n[m]</b> a <i>monomial</i>.


<p>
A <i>multivariate polynomial</i> is taken to be a sum over terms.


<p>
We write <b>c[a]*x^a</b> for a term, where <b> a</b> is a list of
powers for the monomial, and <b> c[a]</b> the <i>coefficient</i> of the 
term.


<p>
It is useful to define an ordering of monomials, to be able to 
determine a canonical form of a multivariate. 


<p>
For the currently implemented code the <i>lexicographic order</i> has 
been chosen:


<p>
<ul><li>first an ordering of variables is chosen, ( </li><b>x[1]</b>, ..., <b>x[m]</b>)
<li>for the exponents of a monomial, </li><b>a</b> = (<b> a[1]</b>, ..., <b>a[m]</b>) the
lexicographic order first looks at the first exponent, <b>a[1]</b>,
to determine which of the two monomials comes first in the multivariate.
If the two exponents are the same, the next exponent is considered.
</ul>

<p>
This method is called <i>lexicographic</i> because it is similar
to the way words are ordered in a usual dictionary. 


<p>
For all algorithms (including division) there is some freedom in 
the ordering of monomials. One interesting advantage of the lexicographic
order is that it can be implemented with a recursive data structure, 
where the first variable, <b>x[1]</b> can be treated as the main variable,
thus presenting it as a univariate polynomial in <b>x[1]</b> with all its
terms grouped together.


<p>
Other orderings can be used, by re-implementing a part of the
code dealing with multivariate polynomials, and then selecting
the new code to be used as a driver, as will be described later
on.


<p>
Given the above ordering, the following definitions can be stated:


<p>
For a non-zero <i>multivariate polynomial</i>


<p>

<p><center><b>f=Sum(a,a[max],a[min],c[a]*x^a) </b></center></p>



<p>
with a monomial order:


<p>
<ul><li></li><b>c[a]*x^a</b> is a <i>term</i> of the multivariate.
<li>the </li><i>multidegree</i> of <b> f</b> is <b> mdeg(f):=a[max]</b>.
<li>the </li><i>leading coefficient</i> of <b>f</b> is <b> lc(f):=c[mdeg(f)]</b>,
for the first term with non-zero coefficient.
<li>the </li><i>leading monomial</i> of <b>f</b> is <b> lm(f):=x^mdeg(f)</b>.
<li>the </li><i>leading term</i> of <b>f</b> is <b> lt(f):=lc(f)*lm(f)</b>.
</ul>

<p>
The above define access to the leading monomial, which is used for
divisions, gcd calculations and the like. Thus an implementation 
needs be able to determine <b><tt> {mdeg(f),lc(f)} </tt></b> . Note the similarity
with the (key,value) pairs described in the sparse tree section.
<b>mdeg(f)</b> can be thought of as a 'key', and <b>lc(f)</b> as a 'value'.


<p>
The <i>multicontent</i>, <b>multicont(f)</b>, is defined to be a term that
divides all the terms in <b>f</b>, and is the term described by
(<b> Min(a)</b>, <b>Gcd(c)</b>), with <b>Gcd(c)</b> the GCD of all the coefficients,
and <b>Min(a)</b> the lowest exponents for each variable, occurring
in <b>f</b> for which <b> c</b> is non-zero.


<p>
The <i>multiprimitive part</i> is then defined as <b> pp(f):=f</b>/<b> multicont(f)</b>.


<p>
For a multivariate polynomial, the obvious addition and (distributive)
multiplication rules hold:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
(a+b) + (c+d) := a+b+c+d 
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
a*(b+c) := (a*b)+(a*c)
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
These are supported in the Piper system through a multiply-add operation:

<p><center><b>muadd(f,t,g):=f+t*g.</b></center></p>

This allows for both adding two polynomials (<b> t:=1</b>), or multiplication
of two polynomials by scanning one polynomial, and multiplying each term
of the scanned polynomial with the other polynomial, and adding the result
to the polynomial that will be returned. Thus there should be an efficient
<b><tt>muadd</tt></b> operation in the system.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Representation
</h3>
For the representation of polynomials, on computers it is natural to do this
in an array: (<b> a[1]</b>, <b>a[2]</b>, ..., <b>a[n]</b>) for a univariate polynomial, and the equivalent
for multivariates. This is called a <i>dense</i> representation, because all
the coefficients are stored, even if they are zero. 
Computers are efficient at dealing with arrays. However, in the case of 
multivariate polynomials, arrays can become
rather large, requiring a lot of storage and processing power even
to add two such polynomials. For instance, <b>x^200*y^100*z^300+1</b>
could take 6000000 places in an array for the coefficients. Of course
variables could be substituted for the single factors, <b> p:=x^200</b>
etc., but it requires an additional ad hoc step.


<p>
An alternative is to store only the terms for which the coefficients
are non-zero. This adds a little overhead to polynomials that could
efficiently be stored in a dense representation, but it is still
little memory, whereas large sparse polynomials are stored in 
acceptable memory too. It is of importance to still be able to
add, multiply divide and get the leading term of a multivariate
polynomial, when the polynomial is stored in a sparse representation.


<p>
For the representation, the data structure containing the 
<b><tt>(exponents,coefficient)</tt></b> pair can be viewed as a database
holding <b><tt>(key,value)</tt></b> pairs, where the list of exponents is
the key, and the coefficient of the term is the value stored
for that key. Thus, for a variable set <b><tt>{x,y}</tt></b> the list <b><tt>{{1,2},3}</tt></b>
represents <b> 3*x*y^2</b>.


<p>
Piper stores multivariates internally as <b><tt>MultiNomial (vars, terms)</tt></b>,
where <b><tt>vars</tt></b> is the ordered list of variables, and terms some 
object storing all the <b><tt>(key, value)</tt></b> pairs representing the terms.
Note we keep the storage vague: the <b><tt>terms</tt></b> placeholder is 
implemented by other code, as a database of terms. The specific
representation can be configured at startup (this is described
in more detail below).


<p>
For the current version, Piper uses the 'sparse tree' representation,
which is a recursive sparse representation. 
For example, for a variable set <b><tt>{x,y,z}</tt></b>, the 'terms' object
contains a list of objects of form <b><tt>{deg,terms}</tt></b>, one for each degree <b><tt>deg</tt></b>
for the variable 'x' occurring in the polynomial. The 'terms'
part of this object is then a sub-sparse tree for the variables <b><tt>{y,z}</tt></b>.


<p>
An explicit example:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; MM(3*x^2+y)
Out&gt; MultiNomial({x,y},{{2,{{0,3}}},{0,{{1,1},
  {0,0}}}});
</pre></tr>
</table>
The first item in the main list is <b><tt>{2,{{0,3}}}</tt></b>, which states that
there is a term of the form <b> x^2*y^0*3</b>. The second item 
states that there are two terms, <b> x^0*y^1*1</b> and <b> x^0*y^0*0=0</b>.


<p>
This representation is sparse:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; r:=MM(x^1000+x)
Out&gt; MultiNomial({x},{{1000,1},{1,1}});
</pre></tr>
</table>
and allows for easy multiplication:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; r*r
Out&gt; MultiNomial({x},{{2000,1},{1001,2},
  {2,1},{0,0}});
In&gt; NormalForm(%)
Out&gt; x^2000+2*x^1001+x^2;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Internal code organization
</h3>
The implementation of multivariates can be divided in three levels.


<p>
At the top level are the routines callable by the user or the rest
of the system: MultiDegree, MultiDivide, MultiGcd, Groebner, etc.
In general, this is the level implementing the operations actually
desired.


<p>
The middle level does the book-keeping of the <b><tt>MultiNomial(vars,terms)</tt></b>
expressions, using the functionality offered by the lowest level.


<p>
For the current system, the middle level is in 
<b><tt>multivar.rep/ sparsenomial.pi</tt></b>, and it uses the sparse tree representation
implemented in <b><tt>sparsetree.pi</tt></b>.


<p>
The middle level is called the 'driver', and can be changed, or 
re-implemented if necessary. For instance, in case calculations need
to be done for which dense representations are actually acceptable,
one could write C++ implementing above-mentioned database
structure, and then write a middle-level driver using the code.
The driver can then be selected at startup. In the file 'piperinit.pi'
the default driver is chosen, but this can be overridden in the 
<b><tt>.piperrc</tt></b> file or some file that is loaded, or at the command line,
as long as it is done before the multivariates module is loaded (which
loads the selected driver). Driver selection is as simple as setting
a global variable to contain a file name of the file implementing the
driver:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
Set(MultiNomialDriver,
  "multivar.rep/sparsenomial.pi");
</pre></tr>
</table>
where "multivar.rep/sparsenomial.pi" is the file implementing the 
driver (this is also the default driver, so the above command would
not change any thing).


<p>
The choice was made for static configuration of the driver before
the system starts up because it is expected that there will in 
general be one best way of doing it, given a certain system with
a certain set of libraries installed on the operating system,
and for a specific version of Piper. The best version can then
be selected at start up, as a configuration step. The advantage
of static selection is that no overhead is imposed: there is no
performance penalty for the abstraction layers between the three levels.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Driver interface
</h3>
The driver should implement the following interface:


<p>
<ul><li></li><b><tt>CreateTerm(vars,{exp,coef})</tt></b> - 
create a multivariate polynomial with one term, in the
variables defined in 'var', with the (key,value) pair
(coefs,fact)
<li></li><b><tt>MultiNomialAdd(multi1, multi2) </tt></b> -
add two multivars, and (possibly) destructively modify multi1 to contain
the result: [ multi1 := multi1 + multi2; multi1; ];
<li></li><b><tt>MultiNomialMultiplyAdd(multi1, multi2,exp,coef)</tt></b> - 
add two multivars, and (possibly) destructively modify multi1 to contain
the result. multi2 is considered multiplied by a term
represented by the (key,value) pair (exp,coef).
[ multi1 := multi1 + term * multi2; multi1; ];
<li></li><b><tt>MultiNomialNegate(multi)</tt></b> - 
negate a multivar, returning -multi, and destructively changing
the original. [ multi := - multi; multi1; ];
<li></li><b><tt>MultiNomialMultiply(multi1,multi2)</tt></b> - 
Multiply two multivars, and (possibly) destructively modify multi1 to contain
the result, returning the result: [ multi1 := multi1 * multi2; multi1; ];
<li></li><b><tt>NormalForm(multi)</tt></b> - 
convert MultiNomial to normal form (as would be typed in be the user).
This is part of the driver because the driver might be able to do
this more efficiently than code above it which can use ScanMultiNomial.
<li></li><b><tt>MultiLeadingTerm(multi)</tt></b> - 
return the (key,value) pair (mdeg(f),lc(f)) representing the leading
term. This is all the information needed about the leading term, 
and thus the leading coefficient and multidegree can be extracted from it.
<li></li><b><tt>MultiDropLeadingZeroes(multi)</tt></b> - 
remove leading terms with zero factors.
<li></li><b><tt>MultiTermLess(x,y)</tt></b> - 
for two (key,value) pairs, return <b><tt>True</tt></b> if <b> x&lt;y</b>, where the operation <b><tt>&lt;</tt></b> is the one used for
the representation, and <b><tt>False</tt></b> otherwise.
<li></li><b><tt>ScanMultiNomial(op,multi)</tt></b> - 
traverse all the terms of the multivariate, applying the
function 'op' to each (key,value) pair (exp,coef). The monomials
are traversed in the ordering defined by MultiTermLess. 'op' should
be a function accepting two arguments.
<li></li><b><tt>MultiZero(multi)</tt></b> - 
return <b><tt>True</tt></b> if the multivariate is zero (all coefficients are zero),
<b><tt>False</tt></b> otherwise.
</ul>

<h2>
<hr>1.3 Integration
</h2>
Integration can be performed by the function <b><tt>Integrate</tt></b>, which
has two calling conventions:


<p>
<ul><li>Integrate(variable) expression
</li><li>Integrate(variable, from, to) expression
</li></ul>

<p>
Integrate can have its own set of rules for specific integrals,
which might return a correct answer immediately. Alternatively,
it calls the function AntiDeriv, to see if the anti-derivative
can be determined for the integral requested. If this is the
case, the anti-derivative is used to compose the output.


<p>
If the integration algorithm cannot perform the integral, the
expression is returned unsimplified.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>The integration algorithm
</h3>
This section describes the steps taken in doing integration.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>General structure
</h3>
The integration starts at the function <b><tt>Integrate</tt></b>, but the
task is delegated to other functions, one after the other.
Each function can deem the integral unsolvable, and thus return
the integral unevaluated. These different functions offer
hooks for adding new types of integrals to be handled.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Expression clean-up
</h3>
Integration starts by first cleaning up the expression, by
calling <b><tt>TrigSimpCombine</tt></b> to simplify expressions containing
multiplications of trigonometric functions into additions of
trigonometric functions (for which the integration rules are
trivial), and then passing the result to <b><tt>Simplify</tt></b>.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Generalized integration rules
</h3>
For the function <b><tt>AntiDeriv</tt></b>, which is responsible for finding
the anti-derivative of a function, the code splits up expressions
according to the additive properties of integration, eg. integration
of <b>a+b</b> is the same as integrating <b> a</b> + integrating <b> b</b>.


<p>
<ul><li>Polynomials which can be expressed as univariate polynomials 
in the variable to be integrated over are handled by one integration rule.
</li><li>Expressions of the form </li><b> p*f(x)</b>, where <b>p</b> represents a 
univariate polynomial, and <b> f(x)</b> an integrable function, are handled
by a special integration rule. This transformation rule has to be designed
carefully not to invoke infinite recursion.
<li>Rational functions, </li><b>f(x)/g(x)</b> with both <b>f(x)</b> and
<b>g(x)</b> univariate polynomials, is handled separately also, using
partial fraction expansion to reduce rational function to a sum
of simpler expressions.
</ul>

<p>

<h3>
<hr>Integration tables
</h3>
For elementary functions, Piper uses integration tables. For instance,
the fact that the anti-derivative of <b>Cos(x)</b> is <b>Sin(x)</b> is
declared in an integration table.


<p>
For the purpose of setting up the integration table, a few
declaration functions have been defined, which use some
generalized pattern matchers to be more flexible in recognizing
expressions that are integrable.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Integrating simple functions of a variable
</h3>
For functions like <b>Sin(x)</b> the anti-derivative can be declared
with the function <b><tt>IntFunc</tt></b>. 


<p>
The calling sequence for <b><tt>IntFunc</tt></b> is


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
IntFunc(variable,pattern,antiderivative)
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
For instance, for the function <b>Cos(x)</b> there is a declaration:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
IntFunc(x,Cos(_x),Sin(x));
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The fact that the second argument is a pattern means that each
occurrence of the variable to be matched should be referred
to as <b><tt>_x</tt></b>, as in the example above.


<p>
IntFunc generalizes the integration implicitly, in that it will
set up the system to actually recognize expressions of the form
<b>Cos(a*x+b)</b>, and return <b>Sin(a*x+b)/a</b> automatically.
This means that the variables <b> a</b> and <b> b</b> are reserved, and
can not be used in the pattern. Also, the variable used (in this 
case, <b><tt>_x</tt></b> is actually matched to the expression passed in to the
function, and the variable <b><tt>var</tt></b> is the real variable being integrated
over. To clarify: suppose the user wants to integrate <b> Cos(c*y+d)</b>
over <b>y</b>, then the following variables are set:


<p>
<ul><li></li><b><tt>a</tt></b> = <b> c</b>
<li></li><b><tt>b</tt></b> = <b> d</b>
<li></li><b><tt>x</tt></b> = <b> a*y+b</b>
<li></li><b><tt>var</tt></b> = <b> x</b>
</ul>

<p>
When functions are multiplied by constants, that situation is
handled by the integration rule that can deal with univariate
polynomials multiplied by functions, as a constant is a polynomial
of degree zero.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Integrating functions containing expressions of the form <b> a*x^2+b</b>
</h3>
There are numerous expressions containing sub-expressions of the form
<b> a*x^2+b</b> which can easily be integrated.


<p>
The general form for declaring anti-derivatives for such expressions
is:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
IntPureSquare(variable, pattern, sign2, sign0,
  antiderivative)
</pre></tr>
</table>
Here <b><tt>IntPureSquare</tt></b> uses <b><tt>MatchPureSquared</tt></b> to match the expression.


<p>
The expression is searched for the pattern, where the variable
can match to a sub-expression of the form <b> a*x^2+b</b>, and
for which both <b> a</b> and <b> b</b> are numbers and <b> a*sign2&gt;0</b>
and <b> b*sign0&gt;0</b>.


<p>
As an example:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
IntPureSquare(x,num_IsFreeOf(var)/(_x),
  1,1,(num/(a*Sqrt(b/a)))*
  ArcTan(var/Sqrt(b/a)));
</pre></tr>
</table>
declares that the anti-derivative of <b> c/(a*x^2+b)</b> is

<p><center><b>c/(a*Sqrt(b/a))*ArcTan(x/Sqrt(b/a)),</b></center></p>

if both <b>a</b> and <b> b</b> are positive numbers.


<p>

<h2>
<hr>1.4 Transforms
</h2>
Currently the only tranform defined is <b><tt>LaplaceTransform</tt></b>,
which has the calling convention:


<p>
<ul><li>LaplaceTransform(var1,var2,func)
</li></ul>

<p>
It has been setup much like the integration algorithm. 
If the transformation algorithm cannot perform the transform, the
expression (in theory) is returned unsimplified. Some cases
may still erroneously return <b><tt>Undefined</tt></b> or <b><tt>Infinity</tt></b>.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>The <b><tt>LaplaceTransform</tt></b> algorithm
</h3>
This section describes the steps taken in doing a Laplace 
transform.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>General structure
</h3>
<b><tt>LaplaceTransform</tt></b> is immediately handed off to <b><tt>LapTran</tt></b>.
This is done because if the last <b><tt>LapTran</tt></b> rule is met, the
Laplace transform couldn't be found and it can then return
<b><tt>LaplaceTransform</tt></b> unevaluated.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Operational Properties
</h3>
The first rules that are matched against utilize the various
operational properties of <b><tt>LaplaceTransform</tt></b>, such as: 


<p>
<ul><li>Linearity Properties
</li><li>Shift properties, i.e. multiplying the function by an exponential
</li><li></li><b>y*x^n=(-1)^n*(Deriv(x,n)LaplaceTransform(x,x[2],y))</b>
<li></li><b>y/x=(Integrate(x[2],x[2],Infinity)LapTran(x,x[2],y))</b>
</ul>

<p>
The last operational property dealing with integration is not
yet fully bug-tested, it sometimes returns <b><tt>Undefined</tt></b> or <b><tt>Infinity</tt></b>
if the integral returns such. 


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Transform tables
</h3>
For elementary functions, Piper uses transform tables. For instance,
the fact that the Laplace transform of <b>Cos(t)</b> is <b>s/(s^2+1)</b> is
declared in a transform table.


<p>
For the purpose of setting up the transform table, a few
declaration functions have been defined, which use some
generalized pattern matchers to be more flexible in recognizing
expressions that are transformable.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Transforming simple functions 
</h3>
For functions like <b>Sin(t)</b> the transform can be declared
with the function <b><tt>LapTranDef</tt></b>. 


<p>
The calling sequence for <b><tt>LapTranDef</tt></b> is


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
LapTranDef( in, out )
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
Currently <b><tt>in</tt></b> must be a variable of <b><tt>_t</tt></b> and <b><tt>out</tt></b> must be a function
of <b><tt>s</tt></b>.
For instance, for the function <b>Cos(t)</b> there is a declaration:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
LapTranDef( Cos(_t),                    s/(s^2+1) );
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The fact that the first argument is a pattern means that each
occurrence of the variable to be matched should be referred
to as <b><tt>_t</tt></b>, as in the example above.


<p>
<b><tt>LapTranDef</tt></b> generalizes the transform implicitly, in that it will
set up the system to actually recognize expressions of the form
<b>Cos(a*t)</b> and <b>Cos(t/a)</b> , and return the appropriate answer.
The way this is done is by three separate rules for case of <b><tt>t</tt></b> itself,
<b><tt>a*t</tt></b> and <b><tt>t/a</tt></b>. This is similar to the <b><tt>MatchLinear</tt></b> function that 
<b><tt>Integrate</tt></b> uses, except <b><tt>LaplaceTransforms</tt></b> must have <b><tt>b=0</tt></b>.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Further Directions
</h3>
Currenlty <b>Sin(t)*Cos(t)</b> cannot be transformed, because it requires
a convolution integral. This will be implemented soon. The inverse
laplace transform will be implement soon also.

<h2>
<hr>1.5 Finding real roots of polynomials
</h2>
<a name="real roots">

</a>
This section deals with finding roots of polynomials in the field 
of real numbers.


<p>
Without loss of generality, the coefficients <b>a[i]</b> of a polynomial

<p><center><b>p=a[n]*x^n+...+a[0] </b></center></p>

can be considered
to be rational numbers, as real-valued numbers are truncated in 
practice, when doing calculations on a computer.


<p>
Assuming that the leading coefficient <b>a[n]=1</b>, the polynomial <b> p</b> can also be written as

<p><center><b> p=p[1]^n[1]*...*p[m]^n[m],</b></center></p>

where <b>p[i]</b> are the <b>m</b> distinct irreducible monic factors of the form
<b> p[i]=x-x[i]</b>, and <b>n[i]</b> are multiplicities of the factors. Here the roots
are <b>x[i]</b> and some of them may be complex. However, complex roots of a
polynomial with real coefficients always come in conjugate pairs, so the
corresponding irreducible factors should be taken as <b>p[i]=x^2+c[i]*x+d[i]</b>. In
this case, there will be less than <b>m</b> irreducible factors, and all
coefficients will be real.


<p>

<a name="square free decomposition">

</a>
To find roots, it is useful to first remove the
multiplicities, i.e. to convert the polynomial to one with multiplicity 1
for all irreducible factors, i.e. find the polynomial <b> p[1]*...*p[m]</b>. This is called the "square-free part" of the original polynomial <b>p</b>.


<p>
The square-free part of the polynomial <b> p</b> can be easily found using the polynomial GCD algorithm.
The derivative of a polynomial <b> p</b>
can be written as:

<p><center><b> p'=Sum(i,1,m,p[1]^n[1]*...*n[i]*p[i]^(n[i]-1)*(D(x)p[i])*...*p[m]^n[m]).</b></center></p>



<p>
The g.c.d. of <b>p</b> and <b> p'</b> equals

<p><center><b> Gcd(p,p')=Factorize(i,1,m,p[i]^(n[i]-1)).</b></center></p>
 
So if we divide <b>p</b> by <b> Gcd(p,p')</b>, we get
the square-free part of the polynomial:

<p><center><b>SquareFree(p):=Div(p,Gcd(p,p'))=p[1]*...*p[m].</b></center></p>



<p>
In what follows we shall assume that all polynomials are square-free
with rational coefficients.
Given any polynomial, we can apply the functions <b><tt>SquareFree</tt></b> and <b><tt>Rationalize</tt></b> and reduce it to this form.
The function <b><tt>Rationalize</tt></b> converts all numbers in an expression to
rational numbers. The function <b><tt>SquareFree</tt></b> returns the square-free
part of a polynomial. For example:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; Expand((x+1.5)^5)
Out&gt; x^5+7.5*x^4+22.5*x^3+33.75*x^2+25.3125*x

<h3>
<hr>Sturm sequences
</h3>
<a name="real roots!Sturm sequences">

</a>
For a polynomial <b>p(x)</b> of degree <b>n</b>, the Sturm sequence
<b> p[0]</b>, <b>p[1]</b>, ... <b>p[n]</b> is defined by the following
equations (following the book [Davenport <i>et al.</i> 1989]):


<p>

<p><center><b>p[0]=p(x),</b></center></p>


<p><center><b>p[1]=p'(x),</b></center></p>


<p><center><b>p[i]= -remainder(p[i-2],p[i-1]),</b></center></p>

where <b>remainder(p,q)</b> is the remainder of division of polynomials
<b>p</b>,  <b> q</b>.


<p>
The polynomial <b> p</b> can be assumed to have no multiple factors, and thus <b> p</b> and
<b> p'</b> are relatively prime. The sequence of polynomials in the 
Sturm sequence are (up to a minus sign) the consecutive polynomials generated  by 
Euclid's algorithm for the calculation of a 
greatest common divisor for <b> p</b> and <b> p'</b>, so the last 
polynomial <b> p[n]</b> will be a constant.


<p>
In Piper, the function <b><tt>SturmSequence(p)</tt></b>  returns the Sturm sequence of <b>p</b>,
assuming <b> p</b> is a univariate polynomial in <b> x</b>, <b> p=p(x)</b>.


<p>

<a name="real roots!variations in Sturm sequences">

</a>
Given a Sturm sequence <b>S=SturmSequence(p)</b> of a polynomial <b>p</b>, 
the <i>variation</i> in the Sturm sequence <b> V(S,y)</b> is the number
of sign changes in the sequence <b>p[0]</b>, <b>p[1]</b> , ... , <b>p[n]</b>, evaluated at point <b>y</b>, and
disregarding zeroes in the sequence.


<p>
Sturm's theorem states that if <b> a</b> and <b> b</b> are two real numbers
which are not roots of <b> p</b>, and <b> a&lt;b</b>, then the number of 
roots between <b> a</b> and <b> b</b> is <b> V(S,a)-V(S,b)</b>. A proof can
be found in Knuth, <i>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2, Seminumerical Algorithms</i>. 


<p>
For <b>a</b> and <b> b</b>, the values <b>-Infinity</b> and <b> Infinity</b>
can also be used. In these cases, <b> V(S,Infinity)</b> is the number
of sign changes between the leading coefficients of the elements
of the Sturm sequence, and <b>V(S,-Infinity)</b> the same, but with
a minus sign for the leading coefficients for which the degree is
odd.


<p>

<a name="real roots!number of">

</a>
Thus, the number of real roots of a polynomial is 
<b>V(S,-Infinity)-V(S,Infinity)</b>. The function
<b><tt>NumRealRoots(p)</tt></b> returns the number of real roots of <b>p</b>.


<p>
The function <b><tt>SturmVariations(S,y)</tt></b> returns the number of sign changes between
the elements in the Sturm sequence <b> S</b>, at point <b> x=y</b>:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">

<h3>
<hr>Finding bounds on real roots
</h3>
<a name="real roots!bounds on">

</a>
Armed with the variations in the Sturm sequence given in the
previous section, we can now find the number of real roots
in a range  (<b> a</b>,<b> b</b>), for <b> a&lt;b</b>. We can thus bound all the roots
by subdividing ranges until there is only one root in each range.
To be able to start this process, we first need some upper bounds of
the roots, or an interval that contains all roots. Davenport gives limits on the roots
of a polynomial given the coefficients of the polynomial, as


<p>

<p><center><b> Abs(a)&lt;=Max(Abs(a[n-1]/a[n]),Abs(a[n-2]/a[n])^(1/2),...,Abs(a[0]/a[n])^(1/n)),</b></center></p>

for all real roots <b>a</b> of <b> p</b>. This gives the upper bound on the
absolute value of the roots of the polynomial in question.
if <b> p(0)!=0</b>, the minimum bound can be obtained also by considering
the upper bound of <b> p(1/x)*x^n</b>, and taking <b> 1/bound</b>.


<p>
We thus know that given 

<p><center><b> a[max]=MaximumBound(p) </b></center></p>

and

<p><center><b>a[min]=MinimumBound(p) </b></center></p>

for all roots <b>a</b> of polynomial, either 

<p><center><b>-a[max]&lt;=a&lt;= -a[min] </b></center></p>

or

<p><center><b>a[min]&lt;=a&lt;=a[max].</b></center></p>



<p>
Now we can start the search for the bounds on all roots. The search
starts with initial upper and lower bounds on ranges, subdividing
ranges until a range contains only one root, and adding that range
to the resulting list of bounds. If, when dividing a range, the middle
of the range lands on a root, care must be taken, because the bounds
should not be on a root themselves. This can be solved by observing
that if <b>c</b> is a root, <b> p</b> contains a factor <b> x-c</b>, and thus
taking <b> p(x+c)</b> results in a polynomial with all the roots shifted 
by a constant <b>-c</b>, and the root <b> c</b> moved to zero, e.g. <b> p(x+c)</b>
contains a factor <b>x</b>. Thus a new ranges to the left and right of
<b> c</b> can be determined by first calculating the minimum bound <b> M</b>
of <b> p(x+c)/x</b>. When the original range was (<b> a</b>,<b> b</b>), and <b> c=(a+b)/2</b>
is a root, the new ranges should become (<b> a</b>,<b> c-M</b>) and (<b> c+M</b>,<b> b</b>).


<p>
In Piper, <b><tt>MimimumBound(p)</tt></b> returns the lower bound described above,
and <b><tt>MaximumBound(p)</tt></b> returns the upper bound on the roots in <b> p</b>.
These bounds are returned as rational numbers.
<b><tt>BoundRealRoots(p)</tt></b> returns a list with sublists with the bounds on
the roots of a polynomial:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; p:=(x+20)*(x+10)
Out&gt; (x+20)*(x+10);
In&gt; MinimumBound(p)
Out&gt; 10/3;
In&gt; MaximumBound(p)
Out&gt; 60;
In&gt; BoundRealRoots(p)
Out&gt; {{-95/3,-35/2},{-35/2,-10/3}};
In&gt; N(%)
Out&gt; {{-31.6666666666,-17.5},
  {-17.5,-3.3333333333}};
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
It should be noted that since all calculations are done with rational
numbers, the algorithm for bounding the roots is very robust. This is
important, as the roots can be very unstable for small variations
in the coefficients of the polynomial in question (see Davenport).


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Finding real roots given the bounds on the roots
</h3>
<a name="real roots!finding">

</a>
Given the bounds on the real roots as determined in the previous section,
two methods for finding roots are available: the secant method or the Newton method, where the function is locally approximated
by a line, and extrapolated to find a new estimate for a root. This 
method converges quickly when "sufficiently" near a root, but can easily fail otherwise.
The secant method can easily send the search to infinity.


<p>
The bisection method is more robust, but slower. It works by taking 
the middle of the range, and checking signs of the polynomial to select the half-range where the root is.
As there is only one root
in the range (<b> a</b>,<b> b</b>), in general it will be true that <b> p(a)*p(b)&lt;0</b>,
which is assumed by this method.


<p>
Piper finds the roots by first trying the secant method, starting
in the middle of the range, <b> c=(a+b)/2</b>. If this fails the bisection
method is tried.


<p>
The function call to find the real roots of a polynomial <b> p</b> in variable <b> x</b>
is <b><tt>FindRealRoots(p)</tt></b>, for example:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; p:=Expand((x+3.1)*(x-6.23))
Out&gt; x^2-3.13*x-19.313;
In&gt; FindRealRoots(p)
Out&gt; {-3.1,6.23};
In&gt; p:=Expand((x+3.1)^3*(x-6.23))
Out&gt; x^4+3.07*x^3-29.109*x^2-149.8199\ 
In&gt; *x-185.59793;
In&gt; p:=SquareFree(Rationalize( \ 
In&gt; Expand((x+3.1)^3*(x-6.23))))
Out&gt; (-160000*x^2+500800*x+3090080)/2611467;
In&gt; FindRealRoots(p)
Out&gt; {-3.1,6.23};
