INTRODUCTION ==================================================================

MPReduceJS is an experimental version of JReduce. JReduce is part of the Reduce
project which is at http://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.net/.



BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS =========================================================

1) Check out the mpreduce_javascript_branch from the MathPiper project repository:
svn checkout http://mathpiper.googlecode.com/svn/branches/mpreduce_javascript_branch mpreducejs

2) Place a copy of ReduceImageInputStream.java into the org.mathpiper.mpreduce package.
Various versions of this file can be found at http://206.21.94.61/misc/ .

3) Obtain a copy of the Google Web Toolkit GWT2.4.0.beta SDK from here:
http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/downloads/list

4) See /home/tkosan/NetBeansProjects/mpreduce_javascript_branch/lib/google_web_toolkit/compile.sh
for where to put copies of the gwt-dev.jar and gwt-user.jar files from GWT2.4.0.beta.

5) Execute "ant gwt_dist". A "build" directory will be created and inside of it
will be a directory called "gwt_dist".

6) Change into the build/gwt_dist directory.

7) Execute the compile.sh script with "sh compile.sh".

8) After the application finishes compiling, the CAS can be launched by opening
the build/gwt_dist/war/mpreduce.html file in a browser.

Note: The CAS does not run properly in IE 8 yet.
