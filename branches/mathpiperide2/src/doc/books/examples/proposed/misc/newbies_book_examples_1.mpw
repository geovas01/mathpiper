/*  v 1.03.
  This is a MathPiperIDE worksheet file and it consists of folds which contain source
  code.  A fold starts with %<keyword> and ends with %/<keyword>.  Code is entered inside
  a fold and then executed by placing the cursor anywhere inside the code and
  pressing <shift><enter>.  The result of the execution will be
  placed at the bottom of the fold within an indented output fold.
  
  Folds can be opened and closed by pressing the small triangles in the gutter
  which is on the left side of the text area.  There are additional fold operations
  in the Folding menu at the top of the window.
  
  This worksheet contains examples which go with the "MathPiperIDE Worksheet Files" chapter
  of the "Introduction to Progamming with Mathpiper" book.
