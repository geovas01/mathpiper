<h2>
<hr>3.1 Example: implementing a formal grammar
</h2>
To illustrate the use of rules, consider a theorem prover in a simple formal
grammar. (The example is the "ABIN system" from the book: W. Robinson,
<i>Computers, minds and robots</i>, Temple University Press, 1992. Warning: the book is about philosophy.)


<p>
Well-formed expressions consist of symbols <b><tt>A</tt></b>, <b><tt>B</tt></b>, <b><tt>I</tt></b>, <b><tt>N</tt></b> and are either


<p>
<ul><li></li><b><tt>B</tt></b> followed by zero or more of <b><tt>I</tt></b>'s, e.g. <b><tt>B</tt></b> , <b><tt>BIII</tt></b> ; or
<li></li><b><tt>N</tt></b> followed by a well-formed expression; or
<li></li><b><tt>A</tt></b> followed by <i>two</i> well-formed expressions.
</ul>

<p>
This defines a certain set of well-formed expressions (statements of the ABIN
language); for example, <b><tt>NBII</tt></b> is a statement of the language but <b><tt>AB</tt></b> is not.
The truth/falsehood interpretation of the ABIN language is the following. All
well-formed expressions starting with <b><tt>NB</tt></b> are interpreted as true statements
(they are "axioms" of the system). In addition, there is one deduction rule
allowing one to prove "theorems":


<p>
<ul><li>If </li><i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are well-formed, then from <b><tt>N</tt></b><i>x</i> follows <b><tt>NA</tt></b><i>xy</i>.
</ul>

<p>
Thus, <b><tt>NABIBI</tt></b> can be proved starting from the axiom <b><tt>NBI</tt></b>, but <b><tt>NANBB</tt></b> cannot
be proved. The task at hand is to decide whether a given sequence of symbols is
a provable statement of the ABIN language.


<p>
(The idea behind this interpretation is to assume that all <b><tt>B</tt></b>, <b><tt>BI</tt></b> etc. are
some false statements that one could denote "B0", "B1" according to the number
of "I" symbols; "N" is the logical <b><tt>Not</tt></b> and "A" is the logical <b><tt>And</tt></b>. Then the
statement <b><tt>NABIB</tt></b> would mean "it is false that both B0 and B1 are true" and
<b><tt>NANBB</tt></b> would mean "it is false that both B0 and negation of B0 are true". The
<b><tt>NANBB</tt></b> statement is true in this interpretation but the deductive system of
ABIN is too weak to obtain its proof.)


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Implementation using predicates
</h3>
The easiest way to model the ABIN language in MathPiper is by using predicates. Our
goal will be to define a predicate <b><tt>IsProvable(x)</tt></b> that will return <b><tt>True</tt></b> when
<b><tt>x</tt></b> is a provable ABIN statement and <b><tt>False</tt></b> otherwise. We shall define
<b><tt>IsProvable(x)</tt></b> recursively through several auxiliary predicates. Naturally, we
would like to have a predicate to test well-formedness: <b><tt>IsExpr(x)</tt></b>. It is
necessary also to have predicates for <b><tt>B</tt></b>-expressions, <b><tt>N</tt></b>-expressions and
<b><tt>A</tt></b>-expressions, as well as for axioms and theorems. We might implement
expressions by lists of symbols, e.g. <b><tt>{"B", "I"}</tt></b> and begin to code by


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
IsExpr(x_IsList) &lt;-- IsBExpr(x) Or
  IsNExpr(x) Or IsAExpr(x);
IsProvable(x_IsList) &lt;-- IsAxiom(x) Or
  IsTheorem(x);
IsAxiom(x_IsList) &lt;-- IsNExpr(x) And
  IsBExpr(Tail(x));
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The definitions of <b><tt>IsBExpr(x)</tt></b> and <b><tt>IsNExpr(x)</tt></b> are simple recursion to
express the rules 1 and 2 of the ABIN grammar. Note the use of <b><tt>Take</tt></b> to create
a copy of a list (we'd better not modify the value of <b><tt>x</tt></b> in the body of the
rule).


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
10 # IsBExpr({}) &lt;-- False;
10 # IsBExpr({"B"}) &lt;-- True;
20 # IsBExpr(x_IsList) &lt;-- x[Length(x)]="I"
  And IsBExpr(Take(x, {1, Length(x)-1}));

10 # IsNExpr({}) &lt;-- False;
20 # IsNExpr(x_IsList) &lt;-- x[1] = "N" And
  IsExpr(Tail(x));
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The predicate <b><tt>IsAExpr(x)</tt></b> is a little bit more complicated because our rule 3
requires to find two well-formed expressions that follow <b><tt>A</tt></b>. Also, for proving
theorems we need to be able to extract the first of these expressions. With
this in mind, we define another auxiliary function, <b><tt>FindTwoExprs(x)</tt></b>, that
returns the results of search for two well-formed expressions in the list <b><tt>x</tt></b>.
The return value of this function will be a pair such as <b><tt>{True, 3}</tt></b> to
indicate that two well-formed expressions were found, the first expression
being of length 3. We shall use a <b><tt>For</tt></b> loop for this function:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
FindTwoExprs(x_IsList) &lt;-- [
 Local(iter, result);
 For( [ iter:=1; result:=False; ],
  iter &lt; Length(x) And Not result,
    iter:=iter+1 )
   [
    result := IsExpr(Take(x, iter))
     And IsExpr(Take(x, {iter+1,
	   Length(x)}));
   ];
 {result, iter-1};
];
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
Now we can define the remaining predicates:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
10 # IsAExpr(x_IsList)_(Length(x) &lt;= 1)
  &lt;-- False;
20 # IsAExpr(x_IsList) &lt;-- x[1] = "A" And
  FindTwoExprs(Tail(x))[1];

IsTheorem(x_IsList) &lt;-- If(IsNExpr(x) And
  IsAExpr(Tail(x)) And IsProvable(
    Concat({"N"}, Take(Tail(Tail(x)),
   FindTwoExprs(Tail(Tail(x)))[2]) ));
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
The ABIN language is now complete. Let us try some simple examples:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; IsExpr({"A","B"});
Out&gt; False;
In&gt; IsExpr({"N","B","I"});
Out&gt; True;
In&gt; IsAxiom({"N","B","I"});
Out&gt; True;
In&gt; IsTheorem({"N","B","I"});
Out&gt; False;
In&gt; IsProvable({"N","B","I"});
Out&gt; True;
In&gt; IsProvable({"N","A","B","I","B"});
Out&gt; True;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
It is somewhat inconvenient to type long lists of characters. So we can create
an interface function to convert atomic arguments to lists of characters, e.g.
<b><tt>AtomToCharList(BII)</tt></b> will return <b><tt>{"B","I","I"}</tt></b> (provided that the symbol
<b><tt>BII</tt></b> has not been given a definition). Then we define a function <b><tt>ABIN(x)</tt></b> to
replace <b><tt>IsProvable</tt></b>.


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
AtomToCharList(x_IsAtom) &lt;-- [
  Local(index, result);
  For( [ index:=Length(String(x));
     result:={}; ],
   index &gt; 0, index:=index-1 )
   Push(result, StringMidGet(index, 1,
     String(x)));
  result;
];
Holdarg(AtomToCharList, 1);
ABIN(x) := IsProvable(AtomToCharList(x));
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; AtomToCharList(NBII);
Out&gt; {"N", "B","I","I"};
In&gt; ABIN(NANBB);
Out&gt; False;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
It is easy to modify the predicates <b><tt>IsTheorem()</tt></b> and <b><tt>IsAxiom()</tt></b> so that they
print the sequence of intermediate theorems and axioms used for deriving a
particular theorem. The final version of the code is in the file
<b><tt>examples/ABIN.pi</tt></b>. Now we can try to check a "complicated" theorem and see an outline of
its proof:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; ABIN(NAAABIIBIBNB);
Axiom {"NBII"}
Theorem NABIIBI derived
Theorem NAABIIBIB derived
Theorem NAAABIIBIBNB derived
Out&gt; True;
</pre></tr>
</table>

<h2>
<hr>3.2 Example: Using rules with special syntax operators creatively
</h2>
Any MathPiper function can be declared to have <i>special syntax</i>: in other
words, it can be made into a prefix, infix, postfix, or bodied operator. In
this section we shall see how prefix, infix, and postfix operators understood
by MathPiper can be adapted to a problem that seems to be far removed from algebra.
Nevertheless it is instructive to understand how rewriting rules are used with
special syntax operators.


<p>
Suppose we want to build a system that understands a simple set of English
sentences and will be able to answer questions. For example, we would like to
say "Tom had an apple and Jane gave 3 apples to Tom"; the system should
understand that Tom has 4 apples now. In the usual LISP-based treatments of
artificial intelligence, this problem would be illustrated with a cumbersome list
syntax such as <b><tt>(had (Tom apple 1))</tt></b> but we would like to use the power of the
MathPiper syntax and use plain English.


<p>
We shall create a set of rules that will "simplify" sentences to atoms such as <b><tt>True</tt></b> or <b><tt>False</tt></b>. As a side-effect, these "simplifications" will maintain a "knowledgebase" of information about all existing persons and objects.


<p>

<h3>

</h3>
The full source of this example is in the file <b><tt>examples/wordproblems.pi</tt></b>. In the next subsection we shall discuss the basic issues of the implementation. For now, here is an example session that shows what functionality we have in mind:


<p>

</table>


<p>
The string "OK" is printed when there is no error, "Note" when there is a
warning, and "Error" on any inconsistencies in the described events. The
special function <b><tt>Knowledge()</tt></b> prints everything the system currently knows.


<p>
Now we shall see how this system can be implemented in MathPiper with very little
difficulty.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Parsing sentences
</h3>
A sentence such as "<b><tt>Mary had a lamb</tt></b>" should be parsed as a valid MathPiper expression. Since this sentence contains more than one atom, it should be parsed as a function invocation, or else MathPiper will simply give a syntax error when we type it in.


<p>
It is logical to declare "<b><tt>had</tt></b>" as an infix operator and "<b><tt>a</tt></b>" as a prefix
operator quantifying <b><tt>lamb</tt></b>. In other words, "<b><tt>Mary had a lamb</tt></b>" should be
parsed into <b><tt>had(Mary, a(lamb))</tt></b>. This is how we can do it:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; [ Infix("had", 20); Prefix("a", 10); ]
Out&gt; True;
In&gt; FullForm(Mary had a lamb)
(had Mary (a lamb ))
Out&gt; Mary had a lamb;
</pre></tr>
</table>
Now this sentence is parsed as a valid MathPiper expression (although we have not
yet defined any rules for the functions "<b><tt>a</tt></b>" and "<b><tt>had</tt></b>").


<p>
Note that we declared the precedence of the prefix operator "<b><tt>a</tt></b>" to be 10. We
have in mind declaring another infix operator "<b><tt>and</tt></b>" and we would like
quantifiers such as "a", "an", "the" to bind more tightly than other words.


<p>
Clearly,  we need to plan the structure of all admissible sentences and declare
all necessary auxiliary words as prefix, infix, or postfix operators. Here are the patterns for our admissible sentences:


<p>
"X <b><tt>is a person</tt></b>" -- this declares a person.  Parsed: <b><tt>is(</tt></b>X<b><tt>,</tt></b> <b><tt>a(person))</tt></b>


<p>
"X <b><tt>and</tt></b> Y <b><tt>are persons</tt></b>" -- shorthand for the above. Parsed: <b><tt>are(and(</tt></b>X<b><tt>,</tt></b> Y<b><tt>),</tt></b> <b><tt>persons)</tt></b>. "person" and "persons" are unevaluated atoms.


<p>
"A <b><tt>is an object</tt></b>" -- this tells the system that "A" can be manipulated. Parsed: <b><tt>is(</tt></b>A<b><tt>,</tt></b> <b><tt>an(object))</tt></b>


<p>
"<b><tt>there are many</tt></b> A<b><tt>s</tt></b>"	-- this tells the system that "A" can be counted (by default, objects are not considered countable entities, e.g. "milk" or "soup"). Parsed: <b><tt>are(there,</tt></b> <b><tt>many(</tt></b>A<b><tt>s))</tt></b>. Here "A<b><tt>s</tt></b>" is a single atom which will have to be stripped of the ending "s" to obtain its singular form.


<p>
"X <b><tt>ate</tt></b> N1 A<b><tt>s</tt></b>", for example, <b><tt>Tom ate 3 apples</tt></b> -- parsed as <b><tt>ate(Tom,</tt></b> <b><tt>apples(3))</tt></b>. Since we cannot make the number <b><tt>3</tt></b> into an infix operator, we have to make <b><tt>apples</tt></b> into a postfix operator that will act on <b><tt>3</tt></b>.


<p>
"X <b><tt>gave</tt></b> N A<b><tt>s to</tt></b> Y" -- Here "N" is a number and "A" is the name of an object. Parsed as: <b><tt>gave(</tt></b>X<b><tt>,</tt></b> <b><tt>to(</tt></b>A<b><tt>s(</tt></b>N<b><tt>),</tt></b> <b><tt>Y))</tt></b>. So <b><tt>to</tt></b> and <b><tt>gave</tt></b> are infix operators and <b><tt>to</tt></b> binds tighter than <b><tt>gave</tt></b>.


<p>
Sentences can be joined by "<b><tt>and</tt></b>", for example:
"<b><tt>Tom</tt></b> <b><tt>gave</tt></b> <b><tt>Jane</tt></b> <b><tt>an apple</tt></b> <b><tt>and</tt></b> <b><tt>Jane</tt></b> <b><tt>ate</tt></b> <b><tt>3 pears</tt></b>". This will be parsed as the infix operator "<b><tt>and</tt></b>" acting on both sentences which are parsed as above. So we need to make "<b><tt>and</tt></b>" of higher precedence than other operators, or else it would bind  <b><tt>(apple</tt></b> <b><tt>and</tt></b> <b><tt>Jane)</tt></b> together.


<p>
"X <b><tt>made</tt></b> <b><tt>some</tt></b> A" -- note that if "A" is not countable, we cannot put a number so we need to write <b><tt>some</tt></b> which is again a prefix operator. <b><tt>made</tt></b> is an infix operator.


<p>
"X <b><tt>ate</tt></b> <b><tt>some</tt></b> A" -- the interpretation is that some A is still left after this, as opposed to "X ate the A" or "X ate A".


<p>
"X <b><tt>gave</tt></b> <b><tt>some</tt></b> A <b><tt>to</tt></b> Y" -- similarly, X still has some A left after this.


<p>
After each sentence, the system should know who has what at that time. Each
sentence is parsed separately and should be completely interpreted, or
"simplified".


<p>
All knowledge is maintained in the variable <b><tt>Knowledge</tt></b> which is an associative list with three entries: 
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
Knowledge := {
	{"objects", {} },
	{"countable objects", {} },
	{"persons", {} }
};
</pre></tr>
</table>
The values under the keys "objects" and "countable objects" are lists of names of
declared objects. The values of the "persons" key is  a doubly nested
associative list that specifies which objects each person has and how many. So,
for example, <b><tt>Knowledge</tt></b>["persons"]["Tom"]["apples"] should give the number of
apples Tom has now, or the atom <b><tt>Empty</tt></b> if he has none.


<p>

<h3>
<hr>Declaring objects
</h3>
Declaring persons is easy: we just create a new entry in the "persons" list. This can be done by an auxiliary routine <b><tt>DeclarePerson()</tt></b>. Note that after we have declared the words "<b><tt>is</tt></b>", "<b><tt>a</tt></b>" to be operators, we can just write the rule using them:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
Infix("is", 20);
Prefix("a", 10);
_x is a person &lt;-- DeclarePerson(x);
</pre></tr>
</table>
Here "<b><tt>person</tt></b>" will be left as an unevaluated atom and we shall never have any
rules to replace it. Some other words such as "object", "objects" or "there"
will also remain unevaluated atoms.


<p>
The operator "<b><tt>and</tt></b>" will group its operands into a list:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
Infix("and", 30);
10 # x_IsList and _y &lt;-- Concat(x, {y});
15 # _x and _y &lt;-- Concat({x}, {y});
</pre></tr>
</table>
So expressions such as "<b><tt>Lisa</tt></b> <b><tt>and</tt></b> <b><tt>Anna</tt></b> <b><tt>and</tt></b> <b><tt>Maria</tt></b>" will be
automatically transformed into <b><tt>{Lisa, Anna, Maria}</tt></b>. We shall adapt our rules
to operate on lists of operands as well as on simple operands and that will
automatically take care of sentences such as "there are many apples and ideas".


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
10 # there are many xs_IsList &lt;--
  MapSingle("DeclareCountable", xs);
20 # there are many _xs &lt;-- DeclareCountable(xs);
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
However, in the present system we cannot simultaneously parse "there are many
apples and ideas" and "Isaac had an apple and an idea" because we have chosen
<b><tt>had</tt></b> to bind tighter than <b><tt>and</tt></b>. We could in principle choose another set of
precedences for these operators; this would allow some new sentences but at the
same time disallow some sentences that are admissible with the current choice.
Our purpose, however, is not to build a comprehensive system for parsing
English sentences, but to illustrate the usage of syntax in MathPiper.


<p>
Declaring objects is a little more tricky (the function <b><tt>DeclareCountable</tt></b>).
For each countable object (introduced by the phrase "there are many ...s") we
need to introduce a new postfix operator with a given name. This postfix
operator will have to operate on a preceding number, so that a sentence such as
"Mary had 3 lambs" will parse correctly.


<p>
If <b><tt>x</tt></b> were an unevaluated atom such as "<b><tt>lambs</tt></b>" which is passed to a
function, how can we declare <b><tt>lambs</tt></b> to be a postfix operator within that
function? The string representation of the new operator is <b><tt>String(x)</tt></b>. But we cannot call <b><tt>Postfix(String(x))</tt></b> because <b><tt>Postfix()</tt></b> does not
evaluate its arguments (as of MathPiper 1.0.49). Instead, we use the function
<b><tt>UnList</tt></b> to build the expression <b><tt>Postfix(String(x))</tt></b> with <b><tt>String(x)</tt></b>
evaluated from a list <b><tt>{Postfix, String(x)}</tt></b>, and we use the function <b><tt>Eval()</tt></b>
to evaluate the resulting expression (which would actually call <b><tt>Postfix()</tt></b>):
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
Eval(UnList({Postfix, String(x)} ));
</pre></tr>
</table>
We also need to declare a rulebase for the operator named <b><tt>String(x)</tt></b>. We use <b><tt>MacroRuleBase</tt></b> for this:
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
MacroRuleBase(String(x), {n});
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
Finally, we would need to define a rule for "<b><tt>had</tt></b>" which can match expressions such as
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
_Person had n_IsNumber _Objects
</pre></tr>
</table>
where <b><tt>_Objects</tt></b> would be a pattern matcher for an unknown postfix operator
such as <b><tt>lambs</tt></b> in our previous example. But we discover that it is impossible
to write rules that match an unknown postfix operator. The syntax parser of
MathPiper cannot do this for us; so we should find a workaround. Let us define a
rule for each object operator that will transform an expression such as {5
lambs} into a list <b><tt>{lambs, 5}</tt></b>. In this list, "lambs" will just remain an
unevaluated atom.


<p>
Incidentally, the parser of MathPiper does not allow to keep unevaluated atoms that
are at the same time declared as <i>prefix</i> operators but it is okay to have
infix or postfix operators.


<p>
A rule that we need for an operator named <b><tt>String(x)</tt></b> can be defined using
<b><tt>MacroRule</tt></b>:
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
MacroRule(String(x), 1, 1, True) {x, n};
</pre></tr>
</table>
Now, after we declare "<b><tt>lambs</tt></b>" as an operator, the routine will define these rules, and <i>anything</i> on which "<b><tt>lambs</tt></b>" acts will be transformed into a list.
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; 5 lambs;
Out&gt; {lambs, 5};
In&gt; grilled lambs
Out&gt; {lambs, grilled};
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
But what about the expression "<b><tt>many lambs</tt></b>"? In it, <b><tt>many</tt></b> is a prefix operator and <b><tt>lambs</tt></b> is a postfix operator. It turns out that for MathPiper it is the <i>prefix</i> operator that is parsed first (and remember, we cannot have unevaluated atoms with the same name as a prefix operator!) so "<b><tt>many lambs</tt></b>" will be transformed into <b><tt>many(lambs)</tt></b> and not into an illegal expression <b><tt>{lambs, many}</tt></b>.

<h3>
<hr>Implementing semantics
</h3>
After implementing all the syntax, the semantics of these sentences is very easy to transform into rules. All sentences are either about how something exists, or about someone "having", "making", "eating", or "giving" certain objects. With the rules described so far, a complicated sentence such as 
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
Ayal gave soup to Serge and Serge ate the soup
</pre></tr>
</table>
will be already parsed into function calls
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
{gave(Ayal, to(soup, Serge)), ate(Serge,
  {soup, 1}}
</pre></tr>
</table>
So now we only need to make sure that all this information is correctly entered
into the knowledgebase and any inconsistencies (e.g. eating something you do
not have) are flagged.


<p>
Here is the simplest rule: "giving" is implemented as a sequence of "eating" and "making".
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
10 # _x gave _obj to _y &lt;-- [
	x ate obj;
	y made obj;
];
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
One more subtlety connected with the notion of "countable" vs. "uncountable" objects is that there are two different actions one can perform on an "uncountable" object such as "soup": one can eat (or give away) <i>all</i> of it or only <i>some</i> of it. This is implemented using the keyword "<b><tt>some</tt></b>" which is a prefix operator that turns its argument into a list,


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
some _obj &lt;-- {obj, True};
</pre></tr>
</table>
This list looks like the result of another quantifier, e.g.
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
the _x  &lt;-- {x, 1};
</pre></tr>
</table>
but in fact the special value <b><tt>True</tt></b> in it is used in the definition of "<b><tt>ate</tt></b>" so that when you "eat" "some" of the object, you still have "some" of it left.


<p>
To implement this, we have made a special rule for the pattern
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
_x had {obj, True} &lt;-- ...
</pre></tr>
</table>
separately from the general rule
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
_x had {obj, n_IsNumber} &lt;-- ...
</pre></tr>
</table>
and its shorthand
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
(_x had _obj )_(Not IsList(obj)) &lt;--
  x had {obj, 1};
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
Admittedly, the module <b><tt>wordproblems.pi</tt></b> has not very much practical use but it
is fun to play with and it illustrates the power of syntactic constructions
from an unexpected angle.
