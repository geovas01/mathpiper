/* Extended Euclidean algorithm. Algorithm taken from
 * "Modern Computer Algebra". It does a Gcd calculation, but
 * returns the intermediate results also.
 *
 * Returns {l,r,s,t}
 * where
 * - l the number of steps required
 * - r[i] the i-th remainder
 * - s[i] and t[i] the i-th bezout coefficients of f and g:
     s[i]*f + t[i]*g = r[i] .
 * The gcd is r[l].
 *
 * This is a slightly modified version from the one described in
 * "Modern Computer Algebra", where the elements in list r are not
 * monic. If needed this can be done afterwards. As a consequence
 * this version works on integers as well as on polynomials.
