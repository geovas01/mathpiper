*CMD KnownFailure --- Mark a test as a known failure
*STD
*CALL
        KnownFailure(test)

*PARMS

[test] -- expression that should return [False] on failure

*DESC

The command [KnownFailure] marks a test as known to fail
by displaying a message to that effect on screen.

This might be used by developers when they have no time
to fix the defect, but do not wish to alarm users who download
MathPiper and type [make test].

*E.G.

In> KnownFailure(Verify(1,2))
        Known failure:
        ******************
         1 evaluates to  1 which differs from  2
        ******************
Result: False;
In> KnownFailure(Verify(1,1))
        Known failure:
        Failure resolved!
Result: True;
