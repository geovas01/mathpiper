*CALL 
        BernoulliDistribution(p)

*PARMS

[p] -- number, probability of an event in a single trial

*DESC 
A random variable has a Bernoulli distribution with probability [p] if
it can be interpreted as an indicator of an event, where [p] is the
probability to observe the event in a single trial.

Numerical value of [p] must satisfy $0<p<1$.
