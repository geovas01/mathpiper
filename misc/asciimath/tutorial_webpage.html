                    This tutorial and accompanying <a href="SymbolList.html">symbol list</a> introduce
                    the ASCIIMath notation and some points of good practice in writing mathematics.
                    To display the mathematics correctly, this page requires Internet Explorer 6 with
                    <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer">MathPlayer</a> installed,
                    or Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape 7+ with MathML fonts installed (e.g. download the <a
                        href="http://web.mit.edu/is/topics/webpublishing/mathml/">MIT MathML font packages</a>).
                    If you have these installed you should see a familiar formula here:</p>

                <p align="center">
                    `x=(-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/(2a)`</p>

                ASCIIMath works by transforming the text you type into mathematics. To see how it
                works, type this text</p>

            It is also possible to put the mathematics between dollar signs like this: \$E=mc^2\$.
            There is no difference in the output.</div>
        <div class="tutorialText">

                As you type, the output appears in the grey coloured area next to the text entry
                box. We want to type mathematics and text, so to indicate mathematics we enclose
                it between left-quotes, like this: \`E=mc^2\`. Because you type the mathematics
                directly, it is quick and easy to include a lot of mathematics in your text.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is easier to read longer formulae if you put them on a separate line, as you
                can see in the text box below (and the output to the right). Take a look at any
                standard mathematics book to see the use of mathematics in the text and on separate

                Try removing the blank lines above and below the equation in the text box above.
                After doing this, the equation will no longer appear on a separate line in the output.
                This is intentional, as sometimes you will want to type an equation on a separate
                line (for easy editing) without that occurring in the output.

        <div class="tutorialText">
            <p>
                If you need to use a mathematical symbol, look it up in the <a href="SymbolList.html">
                    symbol list</a>. ASCIIMath has standard functions predefined, so to get `sin
                x` just type \`sin x\` and `ln x` type \`ln x\`.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="mpar">
            Remember left-quotes (i.e. \`) are used to indicate mathematics.</div>
        <div class="tutorialText">
            <p>
                Greek letters are produced by typing the name of the letter, e.g. \`alpha\` gives
                `alpha` and \`beta\` gives `beta`. To get capital Greek letters, capitalise the
                first letter of the name, e.g. \`Sigma\` gives `Sigma`, whereas \`sigma\` gives
                `sigma`.</p>
            <p>
                For addition and subtraction, just use the symbols on the keyboard. For division,
                type \`3 -: 4\` to get `3-: 4` or \`3//4\` to get `3//4`. There are several symbols
                for multiplication and these are shown in the box below.</p>

            3. Indices, subscripts, fractions and brackets</h2>

        <div class="mpar" style="margin-top: 0px">
            Notice the brackets in \`e^(2x)\` don't appear in the output `e^(2x)`. In the expression
            `f^((3)) (x)` for the third derivative of `f`, we want the brackets to appear so
            we type \`f^((3))(x)\`.</div>
        <div class="tutorialText">
            <p>
                To get an index we use the symbol ^, so for example \`x^2\` gives `x^2`. An index
                that is anything other than a number or a single letter requires brackets. So to
                get `e^(2x)` we type \`e^(2x)\`, because \`e^2x\` gives `e^2x`. However \`p^32\`
                gives `p^32` and \`x^alpha\` gives `x^alpha`.
            </p>
            <p>
                The symbol _ is used for subscripts and they work in the same way as indices. So
                \`x_10\` gives `x_10` and it is necessary to use brackets in \`x_(ij)\` to get `x_(ij)`.

                As you can see above, the symbol \`/\` is used for fractions. Unless they are very
                simple expressions, the denominator and numerator must be enclosed in brackets (which
                don't appear in the output). So, for example
            </p>
            <p>
                `\ \ \ \ ` `1/(x+1)`
            </p>
            <p>
                is achieved by typing \`1/(x+1)\`. What do you think would be produced by typing
                \`1/x+1\`?
            </p>

            <p>
                Both \`x_n/10\` and \`(x_n)/(10)\` give the same output, so sometimes it is not
                necessary to use brackets. Try typing the following expressions and experiment with
                using/missing out brackets to produce the same output.
            </p>
            <p>
                `\ \ \ \ ` `(x+1)/(x+1)` `\ \ \ \ ` `(x+1)/x^2` `\ \ \ \ ` `1/3245` `\ \ \ \ ` `dy/dx`
                `\ \ \ \ ` `(ab)/(cd)`

                i.e. \`\ \`. Extra spaces are especially useful when you want to put more than one

                In the general `m xx n` matrix, we used \`cdots\` for centred dots. This can be
                useful when writing infinite series, for example

                Similarly, for low dots, as in `1, ldots, n` use \`...\` or \`ldots\`.

                The matrix notation can be used for aligning material. When doing this, we will
                want to draw matrices without delimiters. For this purpose, we can type \`{:\` and
                \`:}\` to get invisible brackets. This is necessary when defining a function by
                cases.

                Notice the use of \`text( )\` round
                the comma after `x ge 0` to indicate that it really is a comma and not part of the
                matrix syntax. Try to write the matrix below and then try to write the function
                definition using a matrix with two invisible brackets.
