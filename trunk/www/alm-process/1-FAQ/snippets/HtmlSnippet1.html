Two of its main inspirations are Scott McNeally's concept of &quot;No child held back&quot; (<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/turbogeek/archive/2004/09/no_child_held_b_1.html"> http://weblogs.java.net/blog/turbogeek/archive/2004/09/no_child_held_b_1.html</a> ) and Steve Yegge's observations on learning mathematics:<br /><br />   &quot;1)  Math is a lot easier to pick up after you know how to program. In fact, if you're a halfway decent programmer, you'll find it's almost a snap.<br /><br />   2) They teach math all wrong in school. Way, WAY wrong. If you teach yourself math the right way, you'll learn faster, remember it longer, and it'll be much more valuable to you as a programmer.<br /><br />3) The right way to learn math is breadth-first, not depth-first. You need to survey the space, learn the names of things, figure out what's what.&quot; <br /><br />    (<a target="_blank" href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html</a>)<br /><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">These concepts indicate that MathRider is designed to help a person learn mathematics on their own without the help of a teacher, it makes learning mathematics easier by focusing on how to program first, and it facilitates a breadth-first approach to learning mathematics.</p>  <p><br /><strong>Who is MathRider's audience? </strong><br /><br />Anyone who wants to learn the STEM disciplines and can be convinced to not wait for someone to &quot;teach&quot; them.  MathRider is simple enough that people as young as 10 year olds can begin using it while at the same time it is powerful enough that even STEM professionals will find it useful.<br /><br /><br /><strong>What skills does a person need to have in order to start using Mathrider?</strong><br /><br />The ability to install Java on their system from <a target="_blank" href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a> .  General computer skills (such as navigating a file system, launching applications, downloading and extracting archive files, etc.).  General word processor skills (typing, copy, paste, etc.).  An understanding of arithmetic, a high level of reading comprehension, and a strong desire to gain STEM-related knowledge and skills.<br /><br /><br /><strong>What are some of Mathrider's features? </strong><br /><br />- Numerical mathematics: everything a scientific calculator can do and much more.<br />- Symbolic mathematics: the manipulation of algebraic expressions.<br />- Programming (Yacas, Beanshell, Java, Assembly Language, etc.).<br />- Interactive 2D plotting.<br />- Interactive 3D plotting.<br />- Display of mathematics in traditional form using LaTeX.<br />- The ability to be extended using scripts.<br />- The ability to be extended using plugins.<br />- The ability to integrate almost any STEM-related applet or application.<br />- Display of documentation in HTML and PDF format.                                                                                                                </p>
