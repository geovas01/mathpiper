This package has been built over JMathTeX (http://jmathtex.sourceforge.net) which provides a class TeXFormula to build formulas wrote in LaTeX (for a small set of commands) or in MathML with a TeX rendering. I choose to rewrite a part of JMathTeX because I would add a real LaTeX parser and add the possibility to extend the set of basic commands as the user want.   

You can build the package in using ant.

For the moment, no doc is provided, but it will come soon.

I you notice that a command is missing or if you find a bug don't hesitate to write me at :
      	     	    	    calixte.denizet@ac-rennes.fr

The file TestPNG.java shows how to use the package to parse a set of LaTeX commands.
