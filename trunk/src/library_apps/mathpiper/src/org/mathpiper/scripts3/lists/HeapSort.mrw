*CMD BubbleSort --- sort a list
*CMD HeapSort --- sort a list
*STD
*CALL
	BubbleSort(list, compare)
	HeapSort(list, compare)

*PARMS

{list} -- list to sort

{compare} -- function used to compare elements of {list}

*DESC

This command returns {list} after it is sorted using {compare} to
compare elements. The function {compare} should accept two arguments,
which will be elements of {list}, and compare them. It should return
{True} if in the sorted list the second argument
should come after the first one, and {False}
otherwise.

The function {BubbleSort} uses the so-called "bubble sort" algorithm to do the
sorting by swapping elements that are out of order. This algorithm is easy to
implement, though it is not particularly fast. The sorting time is proportional
to $n^2$ where $n$ is the length of the list.

The function {HeapSort} uses a recursive algorithm "heapsort" and is much
faster for large lists. The sorting time is proportional to $n*Ln(n)$ where $n$
is the length of the list.

*E.G.

	In> BubbleSort({4,7,23,53,-2,1}, "<");
	Out> {-2,1,4,7,23,53};
	In> HeapSort({4,7,23,53,-2,1}, ">");
	Out> {53,23,7,4,1,-2};
