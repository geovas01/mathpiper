*CMD PowerN --- power x^y (arbitrary-precision math function)
*CALL
	PowerN(x,y)

*DESC

This command performs the calculation of an elementary mathematical
function.  The arguments <i>must</i> be numbers.  The reason for the
postfix {N} is that the library needs to define equivalent non-numerical
functions for symbolic computations, such as {Exp}, {Sin}, etc.

Note that all xxxN functions accept integers as well as floating-point numbers.
The resulting values may be integers or floats.  If the mathematical result is an
exact integer, then the integer is returned.  For example, {Sqrt(25)} returns
the integer {5}, and {Power(2,3)} returns the integer {8}.  In such cases, the
integer result is returned even if the calculation requires more digits than set by
{BuiltinPrecisionSet}.  However, when the result is mathematically not an integer,
the functions return a floating-point result which is correct only to the current precision.

*E.G.
	In> BuiltinPrecisionSet(10)
	Out> True
	In> PowerN(2,3)
	Out> 8
	In> PowerN(2,-3)
	Out> 0.125
