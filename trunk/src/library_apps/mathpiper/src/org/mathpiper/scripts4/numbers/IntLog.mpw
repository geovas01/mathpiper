*CMD IntLog --- integer part of logarithm
*STD
*CALL
	IntLog(n, base)

*PARMS

{n}, {base} -- positive integers

*DESC

{IntLog} calculates the integer part of the logarithm of {n} in base {base}. The algorithm uses only integer math and may be faster than computing $$Ln(n)/Ln(base)$$ with multiple precision floating-point math and rounding off to get the integer part.

This function can also be used to quickly count the digits in a given number.

*E.G.
Count the number of bits:
	In> IntLog(257^8, 2)
	Out> 64;

Count the number of decimal digits:
	In> IntLog(321^321, 10)
	Out> 804;
