*CMD GaussianFactors --- factorization in Gaussian integers

*CALL
	GaussianFactors(z)

*PARMS

{z} -- Gaussian integer

*DESC

This function decomposes a Gaussian integer number {z} into a product of
Gaussian prime factors.
A Gaussian integer is a complex number with integer real and imaginary parts.
A Gaussian integer $z$ can be decomposed into Gaussian primes essentially in a
unique way (up to Gaussian units and associated prime factors), i.e. one
can write $z$ as
$$z = u*p[1]^n[1] * ... * p[s]^n[s]$$,
where $u$ is a Gaussian unit and $p[1]$, $p[2]$, ..., $p[s]$ are Gaussian primes. 

The factorization is returned as a list of pairs. The first member of
each pair is the factor (a Gaussian integer) and the second member denotes the power to
which this factor should be raised. So the factorization is returned as 
a list, e.g. {{{p1,n1}, {p2,n2}, ...}}.
