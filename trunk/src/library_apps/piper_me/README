Piper-ME is a port of Yacas/Mathpiper targeting the Java ME platforms
(CLDC 1.1). It has been tested on a Nokia N73 mobile.

Currenly, we only provide the Java-ME enabled library. Application developers
can easily include the interpreter:

    try {
      PiperInterpreter piper = new PiperInterpreter(new DefaultFileLocator());
      System.out.println(piper.evaluate("2+3"));    
    } catch (Piperexception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
    
Piper-ME differs from Yacas/Piper-ME in the following aspects:

1. List presentation, numbers, and collections have been reimplemented
in order to meet the restricted Java-ME API and for smaller memory footprint.

2. Language and scripts follow the changes in Mathpiper, but are usually
several steps behind.
    					 

In order to compile and test the library, perform the following steps:

1. Compile via ant:

>ant

2. Perform tests:

>integrationtest.sh

3. Call piper as a console application:

>piper.sh
