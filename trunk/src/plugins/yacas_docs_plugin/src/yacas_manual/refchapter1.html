1. Introduction
</h1>
<p> </p>
<b><tt>Yacas</tt></b> (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a small and highly flexible
general-purpose computer algebra system and programming language. The language 
has a familiar, C-like infix-operator syntax. The distribution contains a small 
library of mathematical functions, but its real strength is in the language in 
which you can easily write your own symbolic manipulation algorithms. The core 
engine supports arbitrary precision arithmetic, and is able to execute symbolic 
manipulations on various mathematical objects by following user-defined rules.


<p>
You can use <b><tt>Yacas</tt></b> directly from the web site as a Java applet (it runs inside 
your browser without needing a connection to a remote server). This means that
no additional software needs to be installed (other than a free Java environment 
if this is not installed yet). 


<p>
<b><tt>Yacas</tt></b> can also be downloaded. The download contains everything needed to create
this entire web site. It also contains the files needed to build an off-line
version of <b><tt>Yacas</tt></b>, a native executable that can run on your computer. This is
discussed further in another part of the documentation.


<p>
This document describes the functions that are useful in the context of using 
<b><tt>Yacas</tt></b> as an end user. It is recommended to first read the online interactive
tutorial to get acquainted with the basic language constructs first. This document 
expands on the tutorial by explaining the usage of the functions that are useful
when doing calculations.
