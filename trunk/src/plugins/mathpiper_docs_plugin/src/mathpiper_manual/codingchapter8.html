8. Advanced example 2: implementing a non-commutative algebra
</h1>
<p> </p>
We need to understand how to simplify expressions in MathPiper, and the best way is to try writing our own algebraic expression handler. In this chapter we shall consider a simple implementation of a particular non-commutative algebra called the Heisenberg algebra. This algebra was introduced by Dirac to develop quantum field theory. We won't explain any physics here, but instead we shall to delve somewhat deeper into the workings of MathPiper.

<h2>
<hr>8.1 The problem
</h2>
Suppose we want to define special symbols <b>A(k)</b> and <b>B(k)</b> that we can multiply with each other or by a number, or add to each other, but not commute with each other, i.e. <b>A(k)*B(k)!=B(k)*A(k)</b>. Here <b>k</b> is merely a label to denote that <b> A(1)</b> and <b>A(2)</b> are two different objects. (In physics, these are called "creation" and "annihilation" operators for "bosonic quantum fields".) MathPiper already assumes that the usual multiplication operator "<b><tt>*</tt></b>" is commutative. Rather than trying to redefine <b><tt>*</tt></b>, we shall introduce a special multiplication sign "<b><tt>**</tt></b>" that we shall use with the objects <b>A(k)</b> and <b>B(k)</b>; between usual numbers this would be the same as normal multiplication. The symbols <b>A(k)</b>, <b>B(k)</b> will never be evaluated to numbers, so an expression such as <b><tt>2 ** A(k1) ** B(k2) ** A(k3)</tt></b> is just going to remain like that. (In physics, commuting numbers are called "classical quantities" or "c-numbers" while non-commuting objects made up of A(k) and B(k) are called "quantum quantities" or "q-numbers".) There are certain commutation relations for these symbols: the <b>A</b>'s commute between themselves, <b> A(k)*A(l)=A(l)*A(k)</b>, and also the <b>B</b>'s, <b> B(k)*B(l)=B(l)*B(k)</b>. However, the <b>A</b>'s don't commute with the <b> B</b>'s: <b> A(k)*B(l)-B(l)*A(k)=delta(k-l)</b>. Here the "<b><tt>delta</tt></b>" is a "classical" function (called the "Dirac <b>delta</b>-function") but we aren't going to do anything about it, just leave it symbolic.


<p>
We would like to be able to manipulate such expressions, expanding brackets, collecting similar terms and so on, while taking care to always keep the non-commuting terms in the correct order. For example, we want MathPiper to automatically simplify <b><tt>2**B(k1)**3**A(k2)</tt></b> to <b><tt>6**B(k1)**A(k2)</tt></b>. Our goal is not to implement a general package to tackle complicated non-commutative operations; we merely want to teach MathPiper about these two kinds of "quantum objects" called <b><tt>A(k)</tt></b> and <b><tt>B(k)</tt></b>, and we shall define one function that a physicist would need to apply to these objects. This function applied to any given expression containing <b> A</b>'s and <b> B</b>'s will compute something called a "vacuum expectation value", or "VEV" for short, of that expression. This function has "classical", i.e. commuting, values and is defined as follows: VEV of a commuting number is just that number, e.g. <b> VEV(4)=4</b>, <b> VEV(delta(k-l))=delta(k-l)</b>; and <b>VEV(X*A(k))=0</b>, <b> VEV(B(k)*X)=0</b> where <b> X</b> is any expression, commutative or not. It is straightforward to compute VEV of something that contains <b> A</b>'s and <b> B</b>'s: one just uses the commutation relations to move all <b> B</b>'s to the left of all <b> A</b>'s, and then applies the definition of VEV, simply throwing out any remaining q-numbers.

<h2>
<hr>8.2 First steps
</h2>
The first thing that comes to mind when we start implementing this in MathPiper is to write a rule such as


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
10 # A(_k)**B(_l) &lt;-- B(l)**A(k)
  + delta(k-l);
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
However, this is not going to work right away. In fact this will
immediately give a syntax error because MathPiper doesn't know yet about the
new multiplication <b><tt>**</tt></b>. Let's fix that: we shall define a
new infix operator with the same precedence as multiplication.


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
RuleBase("**", {x,y});
Infix("**", OpPrecedence("*"));
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
Now we can use this new multiplication operator in expressions, and it doesn't evaluate to anything -- exactly what we need. But we find that things don't quite work:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; A(_k)**B(_l) &lt;-- B(l)**A(k)+delta(k-l);
Out&gt; True;
In&gt; A(x)**B(y)
Out&gt; B(l)**A(k)+delta(k-l);
</pre></tr>
</table>
MathPiper doesn't grok that <b><tt>delta(k)</tt></b>, <b><tt>A(k)</tt></b> and <b><tt>B(k)</tt></b> are functions. This can be fixed by declaring


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
RuleBase("A", {k});
RuleBase("B", {k});
RuleBase("delta", {k});
</pre></tr>
</table>
Now things work as intended:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; A(y)**B(z)*2
Out&gt; 2*(B(z)**A(y)+delta(y-z));
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>

<h2>
<hr>8.3 Structure of expressions
</h2>
Are we done yet? Let's try to calculate more things with our <b>A</b>'s and <b> B</b>'s:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; A(k)*2**B(l)
Out&gt; 2*A(k)**B(l);
In&gt; A(x)**A(y)**B(z)
Out&gt; A(x)**A(y)**B(z);
In&gt; (A(x)+B(x))**2**B(y)*3
Out&gt; 3*(A(x)+B(x))**2**B(y);
</pre></tr>
</table>
After we gave it slightly more complicated input, MathPiper didn't fully
evaluate expressions containing the new <b><tt>**</tt></b> operation: it didn't
move constants <b><tt>2</tt></b> and <b><tt>3</tt></b> together, didn't expand brackets, and, somewhat
mysteriously, it didn't apply the rule in the first line above -- although
it seems like it should have. Before we hurry to fix these things, let's
think some more about how MathPiper represents our new expressions. Let's start
with the first line above:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; FullForm( A(k)*2**B(l) )
(** (* 2 (A k ))(B l ))
Out&gt; 2*A(k)**B(l);
</pre></tr>
</table>
What looks like <b><tt>2*A(k)**B(l)</tt></b> on the screen is really <b><tt>(2*A(k)) ** B(l)</tt></b> inside MathPiper. In other words, the commutation rule didn't apply because there is no subexpression of the form <b><tt>A(...)**B(...)</tt></b> in this expression. It seems that we would need many rules to exhaust all ways in which the adjacent factors <b><tt>A(k)</tt></b> and <b><tt>B(l)</tt></b> might be divided between subexpressions. We run into this difficulty because MathPiper represents all expressions as trees of functions and leaves the semantics to us. To MathPiper, the "<b><tt>*</tt></b>" operator is fundamentally no different from any other function, so <b><tt>(a*b)*c</tt></b> and <b><tt>a*(b*c)</tt></b> are two basically different expressions. It would take a considerable amount of work to teach MathPiper to recognize all such cases as identical. This is a design choice and it was made by the author of MathPiper to achieve greater flexibility and extensibility.


<p>
A solution for this problem is not to write rules for all possible cases (there are infinitely many cases) but to systematically reduce expressions to a <i>canonical form</i>. "Experience has shown that" (a phrase used when we can't come up with specific arguments) symbolic manipulation of unevaluated trees is not efficient unless these trees are forced to a pattern that reflects their semantics.


<p>
We should choose a canonical form for all such expressions in a way that makes our calculations -- namely, the function <b><tt>VEV()</tt></b> -- easier. In our case, our expressions contain two kinds of ingredients: normal, commutative numbers and maybe a number of noncommuting symbols <b><tt>A(k)</tt></b> and <b><tt>B(k)</tt></b> multiplied together with the "<b><tt>**</tt></b>" operator. It will not be possible to divide anything by <b> A(k)</b> or <b>B(k)</b> -- such division is undefined.


<p>
A possible canonical form for expressions with A's and B's is the
following. All commutative numbers are moved to the left of the expression
and grouped together as one factor; all non-commutative products are
simplified to a single chain, all brackets expanded. A canonical expression
should not contain any extra brackets in its non-commutative part. For
example, (A(x)+B(x)*x)**B(y)*y**A(z) should be regrouped as a sum of two
terms, (y)**(A(x)**(B(y))**A(z)) and (x*y)**(B(x)**(B(y))**A(z)). Here we
wrote out all parentheses to show explicitly which operations are grouped.
(We have chosen the grouping of non-commutative factors to go from left to
right, however this does not seem to be an important choice.) On the screen
this will look simply <b><tt>y ** A(x) ** B(y)</tt></b> and
<b><tt>x*y** B(x) ** B(y) ** A(z)</tt></b> because we have defined the
precedence of the "**" operator to be the same as that of the normal
multiplication, so MathPiper won't insert any more
parentheses.


<p>
This canonical form will allow MathPiper to apply all the usual rules on the commutative factor while cleanly separating all non-commutative parts for special treatment. Note that a commutative factor such as <b><tt>2*x</tt></b> will be multiplied by a single non-commutative piece with "<b><tt>**</tt></b>".


<p>
The basic idea behind the "canonical form" is this: we should define our evaluation rules in such a way that any expression containing <b><tt>A(k)</tt></b> and <b><tt>B(k)</tt></b> will be always automatically reduced to the canonical form after one full evaluation. All functions on our new objects will assume that the object is already in the canonical form and should return objects in the same canonical form.


<p>

<a name="c8s4">

</a>
<h2>
<hr>8.4 Implementing the canonical form
</h2>
Now that we have a design, let's look at some implementation
issues. We would like to write evaluation rules involving the new operator
"<b><tt>**</tt></b>" as well as the ordinary multiplications and
additions involving usual numbers, so that all "classical" numbers and all
"quantum" objects are grouped together separately. This should be
accomplished with rules that expand brackets, exchange the bracketing order
of expressions and move commuting factors to the left. For now, we shall not concern ourselves with divisions and subtractions.


<p>
First, we need to distinguish "classical" terms from "quantum" ones. For this, we shall define a predicate <b><tt>IsQuantum()</tt></b> recursively, as follows:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
    /* Predicate IsQuantum(): will return
	  True if the expression contains A(k)
	  or B(k) and False otherwise */
10 # IsQuantum(A(_x)) &lt;-- True;
10 # IsQuantum(B(_x)) &lt;-- True;
    /* Result of a binary operation may
	  be Quantum */
20 # IsQuantum(_x + _y) &lt;-- IsQuantum(x)
  Or IsQuantum(y);
20 # IsQuantum(+ _y) &lt;-- IsQuantum(y);
20 # IsQuantum(_x * _y) &lt;-- IsQuantum(x)
  Or IsQuantum(y);
20 # IsQuantum(_x ** _y) &lt;-- IsQuantum(x)
  Or IsQuantum(y);
    /* If none of the rules apply, the
	  object is not Quantum */
30 # IsQuantum(_x) &lt;-- False;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
Now we shall construct rules that implement reduction to the canonical form. The rules will be given precedences, so that the reduction proceeds by clearly defined steps. All rules at a given precedence benefit from all simplifications at earlier precedences.


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
  /* First, replace * by ** if one of the
    factors is Quantum to guard against
	user error */
10 # (_x * _y)_(IsQuantum(x) Or
  IsQuantum(y)) &lt;-- x ** y;
    /* Replace ** by * if neither of the
	  factors is Quantum */
10 # (_x ** _y)_(Not(IsQuantum(x) Or
 IsQuantum(y))) &lt;-- x * y;
    /* Now we are guaranteed that ** is
	  used between Quantum values */
    /* Expand all brackets involving
	  Quantum values */
15 # (_x + _y) ** _z &lt;-- x ** z + y ** z;
15 # _z ** (_x + _y) &lt;-- z ** x + z ** y;
    /* Now we are guaranteed that there are
	  no brackets next to "**" */
    /* Regroup the ** multiplications
	  toward the right */
20 # (_x ** _y) ** _z &lt;-- x ** (y ** z);
    /* Move classical factors to the left:
	  first, inside brackets */
30 # (x_IsQuantum ** _y)_(Not(IsQuantum(y)))
  &lt;-- y ** x;
    /* Then, move across brackets:
	  y and z are already ordered
      by the previous rule */
    /* First, if we have Q ** (C ** Q) */
35 # (x_IsQuantum ** (_y ** _z))
  _(Not(IsQuantum(y))) &lt;-- y ** (x ** z);
    /* Second, if we have C ** (C ** Q) */
35 # (_x ** (_y ** _z))_(Not(IsQuantum(x)
  Or IsQuantum(y))) &lt;-- (x*y) ** z;
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
After we execute this in MathPiper, all expressions involving additions and multiplications are automatically reduced to the canonical form. Extending these rules to subtractions and divisions is straightforward.

<h2>
<hr>8.5 Implementing commutation relations
</h2>
But we still haven't implemented the commutation relations. It is perhaps not necessary to have commutation rules automatically applied at each evaluation. We shall define the function <b><tt>OrderBA()</tt></b> that will bring all <b>B</b>'s to the left of all <b> A</b>'s by using the commutation relation. (In physics, this is called "normal-ordering".) Again, our definition will be recursive. We shall assign it a later precedence than our quantum evaluation rules, so that our objects will always be in canonical form. We need a few more rules to implement the commutation relation and to propagate the ordering operation down the expression tree:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
  /* Commutation relation */
40 # OrderBA(A(_k) ** B(_l))
  &lt;-- B(l)**A(k) + delta(k-l);
40 # OrderBA(A(_k) ** (B(_l) ** _x))
  &lt;-- OrderBA(OrderBA(A(k)**B(l)) ** x);
    /* Ordering simple terms */
40 # OrderBA(_x)_(Not(IsQuantum(x))) &lt;-- x;
40 # OrderBA(A(_k)) &lt;-- A(k);
40 # OrderBA(B(_k)) &lt;-- B(k);
    /* Sums of terms */
40 # OrderBA(_x + _y) &lt;-- OrderBA(x)
  + OrderBA(y);
    /* Product of a classical and
	  a quantum value */
40 # OrderBA(_x ** _y)_(Not(IsQuantum(x)))
  &lt;-- x ** OrderBA(y);
    /* B() ** X : B is already at left,
	  no need to order it */
50 # OrderBA(B(_k) ** _x)&lt;-- B(k)
  ** OrderBA(x);
    /* A() ** X : need to order X first */
50 # OrderBA(A(_k) ** _x) &lt;-- OrderBA(A(k)
  ** OrderBA(x));
</pre></tr>
</table>


<p>
These rules seem to be enough for our purposes. Note that the commutation relation is implemented by the first two rules; the first one is used by the second one which applies when interchanging factors A and B separated by brackets. This inconvenience of having to define several rules for what seems to be "one thing to do" is a consequence of tree-like structure of expressions in MathPiper. It is perhaps the price we have to pay for conceptual simplicity of the design.


<p>

<a name="c8s6">

<h2>
<hr>8.6 Avoiding infinite recursion
</h2>
However, we quickly discover that our definitions don't work. Actually, we have run into a difficulty typical of rule-based programming:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; OrderBA(A(k)**A(l))
Error on line 1 in file [CommandLine]
Line error occurred on:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
Max evaluation stack depth reached.
Please use MaxEvalDepth to increase the
  stack size as needed.
</pre></tr>
</table>
This error message means that we have created an infinite recursion. It is easy
to see that the last rule is at fault: it never stops applying itself when it
operates on a term containing only <b>A</b>'s and no <b> B</b>'s. When encountering a term
such as <b><tt>A()**X</tt></b>, the routine cannot determine whether <b><tt>X</tt></b> has already been
normal-ordered or not, and it unnecessarily keeps trying to normal-order it
again and again. We can circumvent this difficulty by using an auxiliary
ordering function that we shall call <b><tt>OrderBAlate()</tt></b>. This function will
operate only on terms of the form <b><tt>A()**X</tt></b> and only after <b><tt>X</tt></b> has been ordered.
It will not perform any extra simplifications but instead delegate all work to
<b><tt>OrderBA()</tt></b>.


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
50 # OrderBA(A(_k) ** _x) &lt;-- OrderBAlate(
  A(k) ** OrderBA(x));
55 # OrderBAlate(_x + _y) &lt;-- OrderBAlate(
  x) + OrderBAlate(y);
55 # OrderBAlate(A(_k) ** B(_l)) &lt;--
  OrderBA(A(k)**B(l));
55 # OrderBAlate(A(_k) ** (B(_l) ** _x))
  &lt;-- OrderBA(A(k)**(B(l)**x));
60 # OrderBAlate(A(_k) ** _x) &lt;-- A(k)**x;
65 # OrderBAlate(_x) &lt;-- OrderBA(x);
</pre></tr>
</table>
Now <b><tt>OrderBA()</tt></b> works as desired.


<p>

<a name="c8s7">

</a>
<h2>
<hr>8.7 Implementing VEV()
</h2>
Now it is easy to define the function <b><tt>VEV()</tt></b>. This function should first execute the normal-ordering operation, so that all <b>B</b>'s move to the left of <b> A</b>'s. After an expression is normal-ordered, all of its "quantum" terms will either end with an <b> A(k)</b> or begin with a <b>B(k)</b>, or both, and <b><tt>VEV()</tt></b> of those terms will return <b>0</b>. The value of <b><tt>VEV()</tt></b> of a non-quantum term is just that term. The implementation could look like this:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
100 # VEV(_x) &lt;-- VEVOrd(OrderBA(x));
    /* Everything is expanded now,
	  deal term by term */
100 # VEVOrd(_x + _y) &lt;-- VEVOrd(x)
  + VEVOrd(y);
    /* Now cancel all quantum terms */
110 # VEVOrd(x_IsQuantum) &lt;-- 0;
    /* Classical terms are left */
120 # VEVOrd(_x) &lt;-- x;
</pre></tr>
</table>
To avoid infinite recursion in calling <b><tt>OrderBA()</tt></b>, we had to introduce an auxiliary function <b><tt>VEVOrd()</tt></b> that assumes its argument to be ordered.


<p>
Finally, we try some example calculations to test our rules:


<p>
<table cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tr><td width=100% bgcolor="#DDDDEE"><pre>
In&gt; OrderBA(A(x)*B(y))
Out&gt; B(y)**A(x)+delta(x-y);
In&gt; OrderBA(A(x)*B(y)*B(z))
Out&gt; B(y)**B(z)**A(x)+delta(x-z)**B(y)
  +delta(x-y)**B(z);
In&gt; VEV(A(k)*B(l))
Out&gt; delta(k-l);
In&gt; VEV(A(k)*B(l)*A(x)*B(y))
Out&gt; delta(k-l)*delta(x-y);
In&gt; VEV(A(k)*A(l)*B(x)*B(y))
Out&gt; delta(l-y)*delta(k-x)+delta(l-x)
  *delta(k-y);
</pre></tr>
</table>
Things now work as expected. MathPiper's <b><tt>Simplify()</tt></b> facilities can be used on the result of <b><tt>VEV()</tt></b> if it needs simplification.
