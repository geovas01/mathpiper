<h3 align=center>Think of 3D-XplorMath-J as a museum -- a Virtual Math Museum</h3>
<hr>  
  
<h3>Galleries and Exhibits</h3>
<p>As with a bricks-and-mortar museum, the objects of this museum are arranged 
into Galleries of related Exhibits; to choose a Gallery you wish to visit, 
just select its name from the "Gallery" menu, and it will become the current 
Gallery. This means its name becomes the name of the Exhibit menu -- the one just 
to the right of the Gallery menu -- and the names of the Exhibits that it contains will
be listed in the Exhibit menu or in one of its sub-menus. (When the program starts up 
you will find yourself in the <i>Surface Gallery</i>.)</p>
<br>


<h3>Viewing Exhibits</h3>
<p>When an Exhibit is selected by name from the Exhibit menu, the program immediately
displays a default representation of that Exhibit.  In many cases, an animation 
will play that shows the "creation" of the object.  This illustrates a basic feature
of the program: wherever possible, the program assigns carefully chosen default 
values to various parameters and options needed to display an Exhibit; it creates 
the view of the Exhibit corresponding to these default choices; and it then allows 
the user to alter one or more of these defaults by making various menu choices, by
entering values in dialogs, or by clicking buttons in control panels. The program 
will then display the new representation of the same Exhibit appropriate for 
these user choices. We next explain in more detail some of the more important 
methods of modifying an Exhibit in this way.</p>
<br>

<h3>Using the Mouse</h3>
<p>3D-XplorMath-J is designed to be a highly interactive program, and the mouse is an 
important tool for telling the program what you want. The first thing you should learn 
is that clicking the mouse during a drawn out action will usually abort it, possibly
after a short delay. (On the other
hand if you just want to pause an animation, tap the space bar; then tap it again to continue 
the animation.)</p>
<p>In two-dimensional Galleries, you can generally move the image around on the screen by 
clicking-and-dragging with the mouse.  If you click-and-drag with the right-mouse button (or, 
on Mac OS, while holding down the Command key), you can select a rectangular portion of the
image to be magnified.  If you hold down the Shift key while dragging, or if you
drag with the middle mouse button, you can zoom in and out on the image by dragging
the mouse up and down.</p>
<p>In three-dimensional Galleries, clicking-and-dragging with the mouse will generally
rotate the object in three dimensions, and if you release the mouse button while you are 
in mid-drag, the object will continue to  rotate.  To move the object around, drag
it with the right mouse button (or while holding down the Command key on Mac OS).
And, just as in two dimensions, holding down the Shift key and dragging up and down will 
expand or contract the object on the screen.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to these general rules about using the mouse.  In some
cases, the exception will be noted in the status line at the bottom of the window.</p>
<br>

<h3>The Action Menu</h3>
<p>While most menus of the program change little if at all when the current Exhibit is
changed to another in the same Gallery, or even when the Gallery changes, the "Action" 
menu changes substantially when the Gallery changes, and certain individual
Exhibits within a Gallery often have associated to them special Action menu items
that help explain some unusual detail of that Exhibit. As a result, after selecting 
an Exhibit for the first time, it is a good idea to check and see if the "Action" menu 
has any such special items.  The top item of the "Action" menu does not vary; it is 
always "Create."  Selecting "Create" will generally show the same animation that is
played when the Exhibit is first selected, but incorporating any changes that you
have made to the properties of the Exhibit.</p>
<p>What sort of things are in the "Action" menu? Here are some typical examples. For 
<i>Plane Curves</i> there is an item "Show Osculating Circles". For <i>Conformal Maps</i> you can 
choose to draw a circle or a line and see how it gets mapped. And for <i>Polyhedra</i> you 
can choose among seeing a normal, truncated or stellated view.</p>
<br>

<h3>The View Menu</h3>
<p>One should keep in mind that mathematical objects are abstract concepts, so that 
the possibilities for representing them visually admit considerable flexibility and 
choice. There are simple options, such as whether to show an object on a white, black, 
or colored background, and in three dimensions there are important additional options,
such as whether to use orthographic or perspective projection and whether to use 
mono- or stereo vision. These choices and more are controlled from the "View" menu.</p>
<p>The stereo views require some explanation. These views enable you to view true
three-dimensional representations of an object.  "Anaglyph Stereo Vision" is meant
to be viewed using red/blue or red/green stereo glasses (with the red lens over the
left eye); it gives a clear and easy-to-see three-dimensional effect, but the object
appears in shades of yellow rather than in color.  "Cross-eyed Stereo Vision" shows
two copies of the object side-by-side, showing the object from the perspective of
the left and right eyes.  To get the three-dimensional effect, you have to cross
your eyes to merge the two images.  "Parallel Stereo Vision" is similar, but you
must merge the two images by gazing as if at a point that lies a foot or so behind the screen.
It takes some practice to learn how to merge the images, but the result should be
a clear, full-color three-dimensional image.</p>
<br>

<h3>The Animate Menu: Parameters and Morphing</h3>
<p>Most Exhibits are not unique, single mathematical objects. Rather, Exhibits come 
in parameterized families. For example, the Ellipsoid Exhibit has three parameters, 
corresponding to the lengths of its three axes, and similarly a torus is described 
by two radii. When an object is selected from the Exhibit menu, the program displays 
it with special (but typical) default choices of these parameters that, as will be 
explained below, can then be altered with the "Set Parameters..." command in
the "Settings" menu. But something more interesting can also be done to get a clear 
idea of how the appearance of an object changes as one or more of its parameters 
vary, and this is called <i>morphing</i>. Many Exhibit parameters are "morphable," meaning 
that one can choose "initial" and "final" values for these parameters. Then, when the
"Morph" command is chosen from the "Animate" menu, the program creates an animation by rapidly
drawing a sequence of images of the object, starting from the initial values of the 
parameters and ending with their final values, giving the illusion that the object 
is smoothly morphing from its initial to its final shape. In some cases (particularly 
in the Plane Curves, Polyhedra, and Ordinary Differential Equation Galleries) the 
program is able to render individual images fast enough that the morph can be 
created on the fly, but in most cases, to get a sufficiently smooth morph, the 
individual images must be saved in memory as they are created and then played back 
in rapid succession as a a flip-book animation.  (In general, it is best to vary 
just one parameter at a time, making the initial and final values of the others equal.)</p>
<br>

<h3>The Settings Menu</h3>
<p>The "Settings" menu is the center for changing the various parameters and options
that define the current appearance of an Exhibit. Selecting an item from this menu, 
will in most cases bring up a dialog box where the new values can be entered. For example, as 
mentioned above, selecting "Set Parameters..." will bring up a dialog allowing you 
to change any of the parameters that are associated with the current Exhibit, while
"Set Morphing..." will let you to set the initial and final values for these parameters 
during a morphing animation. "Set Number of Frames..." allows changing the number of 
frames in a morphing animation -- increasing this will make the animation take longer 
but it will be smoother.  "Set Visible Ranges..." lets you adjust the size and the
placement of the Exhibit by setting the horizontal and vertical edges of the rectangular region
that is displayed in the window.  In three dimensions, "Set Viewpoint and Up Direction..." allows you to set the 
location and orientation in space of the virtual camera that is used to image a 
three-dimensional Exhibit on its focal plane.  And for surfaces, "Light Settings..." will 
bring up a dialog in which you can set the colors of the lights shining on the surface
and the directions in which the lights point.</p>
<br>

<h3>The File Menu: Settings Files, Snapshots, and Multiple Windows</h3>
<p>Using the "File" menu, it is possible to save a snapshot of the current visualization 
of an Exhibit, either as a JPEG or PNG file. It is also possible to save the identity 
of the current Exhibit together with all its parameters and options in a so-called 
settings file, by selecting "Save Exhibit to File..." in the "File" menu.  If you later 
open this settings file, using the "File" menu command "Open Settings File...", the 
program will return to the state it had when the file was created. (And you can share
your work by sending the settings file as an email attachment to a friend.) 
Saving an Exhibit to a file also works with user-defined Exhibits (see below), and is 
particularly useful in this case since it in effect allows you to create and distribute 
entirely new Exhibits that are not in the 3D-XPlorMath-J repertory.</p> 
<br>

<h3>User Defined Exhibits</h3>
<p>When we began this introduction to 3D-XplorMath-J, we said that you should think of it  
as a museum. But now we want to explain in what sense you can also think of it as a 
mathematical laboratory, using so called user-defined Exhibits.</p>
<p>Most (but not all) Galleries contain at least one User Defined Exhibit. These at first 
glance seem similar to other Exhibits of the Gallery. However when you first select a
User Defined Exhibit, you will see a dialog box, much like a "Set Parameters..." dialog,
except that in addition to the usual boxes to reset the values of various parameters, 
there will also be text boxes where you can enter mathematical formulas that describe an 
Exhibit of the Gallery. As usual, these will have default values, and you can just click 
OK and see the Exhibit these defaults describe. But of course it is more interesting to 
replace these default formulas by formulas of your own. For example, if in the Plane Curves
Gallery, you select User Plane Curve (parametric), the default equations are 
<i>x(t) = a * cos(t)</i> and <i>y(t) = b * sin(2*t)</i> (where <i>a</i> 
has the value 3 and <i>b</i> the value 1.5).
If you accept these values by clicking OK you will get a "figure eight", but if you replace 
<i>sin(2*t)</i> by <i>sin(t)</i> you will get an ellipse.</p>
<p>By the way, once you have created a user-defined exhibit, it you want to edit your formulas and 
parameters, do not re-select the User Defined Exhibit from the Exhibit menu -- this will give 
back the original defaults.  Instead, select "Change User Data..." from the Settings menu.</p>
