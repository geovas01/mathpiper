    hosting plugin applications without imposing any requirements on the design
    or function of the plugin itself. You could write an application that
    performs spell checking, displays a clock or plays chess and turn it into a
    jEdit plugin. There are currently over 50 released plugins for jEdit. While
    none of them play chess, they perform a wide variety of editing and file
    management tasks.</p><p>A detailed listing of available plugins is available at <a href="http://plugins.jedit.org" target="_top">plugins.jedit.org</a>. You can also find
    beta versions of new plugins in the &#8220;<span class="quote">Downloads</span>&#8221; area of <a href="http://community.jedit.org" target="_top">community.jedit.org</a>.</p><p>Using the &#8220;<span class="quote">Plugin Manager</span>&#8221; feature of jEdit, users with
    an Internet connection can check for new or updated plugins and install and
    remove them without leaving jEdit. See <a href="using-plugins.html" title="Chapter 9. Installing and Using Plugins">Chapter 9, <i>Installing and Using Plugins</i></a> for
    details.</p><p>Requirements for &#8220;<span class="quote">plugging in</span>&#8221; to jEdit are as
    follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>This plugin must supply information about itself, such as its
            name, version, author, and compatibility with versions of
            jEdit.</p></li><li><p>The plugin must provide for activating, displaying and
            deactivating itself upon direction from jEdit, typically in response
            to user input<sup>[<a name="id497049" href="#ftn.id497049">1</a>]</sup>. Make sure you can continue to use both your plugin
            and the editor after it has been reloaded.</p></li><li><p>Each Plugin has an ActionSet defined by jEdit, which is added
            to the main ActionContext. The ActionSet is a container for
            EditAction instances. The plugin may define
            <em class="firstterm">actions</em> in a number of ways. One way is
            explicitly, with an action definition file known as
            <code class="literal">actions.xml</code>. Another is implicitly, by defining
            dockable windows in <code class="literal">dockables.xml</code>.</p><p>Most EditActions are small blocks of BeanShell code that jEdit
            will perform on behalf of the plugin upon user request. They provide
            the &#8220;<span class="quote">glue</span>&#8221; between user input and specific plugin
            routines.</p><p>By convention, plugins display their available actions in
            submenus of jEdit's <span><strong class="guimenu">Plugins</strong></span> menu; each menu item
            corresponds to an action. Plugin authors do not define specific
            shortcuts - the user can/will assign EditActions to keyboard
            shortcuts, toolbar buttons, or entries in the text area's Context
            menu (right-click menu).</p></li><li><p>The plugin may, but need not, provide a user interface.</p><p>If the plugin has a visible interface, it can be shown in any
            object derived from one of Java top-level container classes:
            <code class="classname">JWindow</code>, <code class="classname">JDialog</code>, or
            <code class="classname">JFrame</code>. jEdit also provides a dockable window
            API, which allows plugin windows derived from the
            <code class="classname">JComponent</code> class to be docked into views or
            shown in top-level frames, at the user's request.</p><p>Plugins can also act directly upon jEdit's text area. They can
            add graphical elements to the text display (like error highlighting
            in the case of the <span class="application">ErrorList</span> plugin) or
            decorations surrounding the text area (like the
            <span class="application">JDiff</span> plugin's summary views). These
            plugins are dependent on the JEditTextArea class, which is currently
            getting refactored.</p></li><li><p>Plugins may provide a range of options that the user can
            modify to alter their configuration.</p><p>If a plugin provides configuration options in accordance with
            the plugin API, jEdit will make them available in the
            <span><strong class="guilabel">Global Options</strong></span> dialog box.</p></li><li><p>While it is not required, plugins are encouraged to provide
            documentation.</p></li></ul></div><p>As noted, many of these features are optional; it is possible to write
    a plugin that does not provide actions, configuration options, or dockable
    windows. The majority of plugins, however, provide most of these
    services.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Plugins and different jEdit versions</b></p><p>As jEdit continues to evolve and improve, elements of the API may
        change with a new jEdit release.</p><p>On occasion an API change will break code used by plugins,
        although efforts are made to maintain or deprecate plugin-related code
        on a transitional basis. While the majority of plugins are unaffected by
        most changes and will continue working, it is a good idea to monitor the
        jEdit change log, and join the <code class="literal">jedit-devel</code> mailing list, to keep updated on changes and bug reports, so that you will know when your
        plugin needs to be updated.
