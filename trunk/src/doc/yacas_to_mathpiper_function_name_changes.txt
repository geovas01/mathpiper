============================== Proposed function name changes: 

Change the bodied operators D, Integrate, Limit, and Taylor to non-bodied operators to make function calls uniform and to reduce confusion.
MM -> MultinomialForm
Normalize -> NormalizeVector
FW -> ?
FWatom -> ?
All Gets and Sets should be at the end of a function's name.

-b MacroRuleBaseListed  -> MacroRulebaseListed
-RuleBaseArgList -> RulebaseArgumentsList
-NrArgs -> ArgumentsCount
