MathRider with JavaYacas.

As promised, here is an alpha version of MathRider which contains JYacas
if anyone would like to play with it:

Here is a screen shot of MathRider

And here are instructions for testing it:

1) Make sure you have a current version of Java (Java 6) installed (http://java.com).

2) Download the mathrider_xxx_dist_.03.zip file and extract it.

3) Run the application by executing the windows_run.bat script or the run.sh
script.


Playing with JYacas:

1)  The lower left window contains consoles.  Switch the console to
JYacas by pressing the little black inverted triangle which is near
the word "System".  Select the JYacas console and when it comes up,
enter expressions and execute them by pressing <enter>.

2) The Yacas programs in the text windows can be executed by placing
the cursor in a window and pressing <shift><enter>.  The output will
be displayed in the JYacas console window.


For the rest of the testing you are going to need to use your
imagination and try to envision what MathRider can become as opposed
to what it currently is.

Plugins:

1) GeoGebra works but it is not connected to JYacas yet.  Its main use
at this point is to show how MathRider plugins work.  At the right
side of the window is a small tab that has "Geogebra" written on it.
Press this tab a number of times to see what happens (GeoGebra should
be shown and hidden as you press the button.)

2) You can also press the tabs at the bottom of the screen which read
"Activity Log", "Console", and "Error List".  These are all plugins
and you can show them or hide them as needed.

3) Go back to the Geogebra plugin and press the small black inverted
triangle that is near it.  A popup menu will appear which has menu
items such as "Float", "Dock at Top", etc.  Select the "Float" menu
item and see what happens.

4) The Geogebra plugin was detached from the main window so it can be
resized and placed where needed.  Select the inverted black triangle
on the floating windows and try docking the Geogebra plugin back to
the main window again, perhaps in a different position.

5) Try moving the plugins at the bottom of the screen around the same
way (and try not to have too much fun doing this :-)

6) Go to the "Plugins" menu at the top of the screen and select the
Calculator plugin.  You can also play with docking and undocking it if
you would like.


The future (more imagination needed).

1) Go back to the "Plugins" menu at the top of the screen and select
the "Plugin manager" menu.  When it comes up select the "Install" tab
and wait for a few moments.  A list of programmer-oriented plugins
will appear that can be downloaded from the Internet and plugged into
MathRider.  Click on any plugin's name to read about what it does.
Now, imagine that these programmer-oriented plugins were replaced by
dozens of mathematics-oriented plugins.  This is one part of the
vision I have for MathRider.

2) Just for fun, select the CharacterMap plugin by checking its
checkbox and install it by pressing the "Install" button.  After it is
finished downloading from the internet, close the plugin manager, find
the CharacterMap plugin in the "Plugins" menu, launch it, and
experiment with docking it.

Finally, whatever configuration the plugins are in when you close
MathRider, they will be preserved when it is launched again.
