+This should give a result other than 5E1: 
In> N(1/.02)
Result> 5E1
+I think this is a bug.  If an associative list is assigned to a variable multiple times, the list grows instead of being replaced.
+There is a bug in the assignment operator (:=).  7/16 := z  treats 7/16 as a variable name.  Similarly, 7*6 := z.
+IsInteger exists, but is not in the API docs.
+Experimenting with HighschoolForm rules.

+Simplify can't simplify (2*Sqrt((4*((a^2+b^2)/a^2-1))/b^2)*b^2)/2  Should simplify to (2*b^2)/a
+Solve cannot solve the following for y: Sqrt((x+25)^2+y^2)-Sqrt((25-x)^2+y^2)==40
+We might be able to implement a MathPiper Clear(*) function by having a file which holds the global variables which should be present when MathPiper first launches and then clearing all variables except the ones on this list.
+MathPiper solve bug: Solve((x^2)^(1/2)==y, x)
It may not be as easy as you think, if you are suggesting that the
algebra system should simplify (x^2)^(1/2) to x. For real x,
(x^2)^(1/2) is equal to the absolute value |x|, and it gets even more
complicated when the numbers are complex.

Of course, it would be easy to find the solutions x=y and x=-y to the
equation above, but I don't quite see how this could be generalized to
a significantly larger cIass of functions. I believe this is why Yacas
fails to solve your equation.

+String processing needs to be significantly improved.  For example, turing lists into strings and strings into lists.  Also, perhaps use Python's string processing functions as a guide.
+Rounding to a specified number of digits still needs to be implemented.
+The While and For functions need a way to break and continue.
+Functions need a return statement.

+ExpandFrac() is a function.
+ CharString() is a function.  Research it.
+ GroupLayoutManager needs to be bundled with the calculator applet because Macs don't include it in their Java 1.6.
Hi dovev, I just tried the whole story in this blog entry again. I used 5.5 RC 1. In step 4, I only needed this:
<target name="-post-jar">
    <jar update="true" destfile="${dist.jar}">
        <zipfileset src="${libs.swing-layout.classpath}"/>
</target>
In other, words, I didn't need those other two JAR files. If you add the above, you'll be bundling the group layout manager (Matisse) 
with the application, which is necessary because that's what you used when you designed the applet form. However, group layout is
part of JDK 1.6, so if you're using that, then you don't need to include the group layout manager library in the build script as above.
I deployed the application to GlassFish (Sun Java System Application Server), because that supports JAX-WS, while Tomcat doesn't. 
+ BranchingUserFunction uses Vectors.  Perhaps switch to ArrayLists to improve speed.
+ Change name of Printer to LispPrinter.  Move all printers into a single package.  Change name of FullForm to LispForm.  Create
MathPiperForm() function.
+ Log the version of mathrider and the version of mathpiper into the activity log.  The subversion version number should also be logged.
+ Internal'xxx functions are created for the cached constants.
CachedConstant(CacheOfConstantsN, gamma, GammaConstNum());
CachedConstant(CacheOfConstantsN, GoldenRatio, N( (1+Sqrt(5))/2 ) );
CachedConstant(CacheOfConstantsN, Catalan, CatalanConstNum() );
Pi, etc.
+ There are still a number of "numeric" commands which start with the word Math (check the BuiltinFunctionInitialize class).  
However, some of these might not be "numeric" but simply built in.
+ Document that the underscore character and the back quote character are operators.
+ Where is the RandomInteger() function?
+Enhance range operator (..) to step by a given value.  
Perhaps something like 1,3 .. 20 can be used with 3 being the step value. 
+Add a way to extract rows and columns (vectors) from matrices.
+This code causes the wrong line to be highlighted when an error:
A := {{8,4,-3},{6,2,-4},{4,-3,6}};
v:=14,-4,32;
SolveMatrix(A,v);
+One should be able to multiply an equation by a value.
This example is from Maxima:
(%i1) e1 : 3*x + 2*y = 7;
(%o1) 2*y+3*x=7
(%i2) e1*3;
(%o2) 3*(2*y+3*x)=21
(%i3) expand(%o2);
(%o3) 6*y+9*x=21
But MathPiper does not perform the multiplication:
In> e1 := 3*x+2*y==7
Result> 3*x+2*y==7
In> e1*3
Result> 3*(3*x+2*y==7)
In> Expand(%)
Result> 3*(3*x+2*y==7)
Ted Kosan 12/27/08.
01/06/09: from Sherm:
Yes, but why should you care?  If you do Solve(3*e1,x) you get the correct answer.
Is there really a problem here? 
However, if you want me to try to "fix" this, add it to the Issues.

+ yd^2 := ft^2/9;A'room := 18*ft*24*ft; causes an exception which crashes MathPiper.
+ It would be nice if MathPiper can be placed into numeric mode like NOn() and NOff().
+ Functions like ToDeg() and ToRad() are needed.
-  Enable the display of exceptions in the MathRider MathPiper console and perhaps also in the MathPiper text console.
+ MathPiper has if/else structure!: if( IsZero(Re(x)) )[
                        ( Abs(Im(x)) % 4 = 3 And IsPrime(Abs(Im(x))) );

+ There is a bug in the FindFunction() function which will not check function names in a case-sensitive way.  For example, in this .def file, TexForm() was "hiding" TeXForm().  I moved TeXForm() higher up in the .def file as a temporary workaround for this bug.
+ The Version() function is not listed in the documentation.
+PrettyPrinter'Get and PrettyPrinter'Set are not in MathPiperDocs.

+ A number of keywords are missing from the MathPiper mode.
+ There should be a way to manipulate (a*x + b*y == r)/2 so that the parentheses can be removed.

%/mathpiper
doesn't clear the output fold and display "Processing..." when data is already in it.
+ Instead of removing just output folds, remove any fold that has preserve="false".
+ Figure out why lines which begin with { do not wrap in .mrw worksheets.
+ Put mathpiper syntax highlighting in console.
+ Some function implimentations like MathArcCos (now ArcCosN) seem to be missing.
+ Create a macro which converts a fold from OpenOffice into an executibale fold.
+ Change Factorize calling format 1 to Product, change Sum to SumSequence, change Factorize calling format 2 to ProductSequence.
+ In MathPiper, Swap() should be called DestructiveSwap().
+ Remove is in MathPiper_Docs but it is not in MathPiper.

- Place all IsXXX predicate functions in the predicate node in PiperDocs.
+ Again, figure out a way for piper folds to always return the result of the
last evaluation without needing to use Write;
+ Provide a way to reset piper without relaunching MathRider.

+ Add fit function to GeoGebra so that plots can be autozoomed to fit the display area.
+ Add Clojure to MathRider.
+ Develop an Application Specific Language for GeoGebra.
+ The %geogebra fold syntax hilights the letter D.

+ Have the GeoGebra plugin associated with view the %geogebrafold was executed in show the result.
+ Automate the placing of version information in plugin documentation (including UASM65).
+ My concern is mostly "Java IDE kung-fu": users of these libraries (mostly just me :-) only want the highest level APIs to show in popup completion lists and the entire set of implementation classes remain invisible. The solution is easy: a public API class with implementation classes in the same package with package-ony (i.e., neither public or private) visibility..
+ All Functions category gives duplicates when function names contain ` characters.
+ There are other duplicate function names in All Functions.
+ Add menu items back when ready: help-menu=about help tip-of-the-day.
+ Need to work on more sophisticated fold property parser.  For example, what is a good way to part this?: (%piper,output="output,preserve="false",name="test"",name="test2").
+ Property scope="ide" throws null pointer exception when beanshell gui code is executed in worksheet_demo_1.mrw file.
+"All buffer-local properties listed in the section called Â“Buffer-Local PropertiesÂ” may be given values in edit modes." so perhaps set the folding mode here instead of in the system properties file?

+ Perhaps add grade level (or similar) tags to functions to hide advanced functions in piper docs.
+ Have Piper docs go to cateorgy's html reference page when category is selected.
+ Add scope="shell" to beanshell fold.
+ Add IsInteger to PiperDocs (There are a number of links to it, but no target).
+ Give option for Piper functions to be grouped bye type.  For example, predicates(refchap10), numeric functions(like MathSin), etc. Perhaps use a tree. 
+ Why is the MathRider startup script in the settings directory and in the MathRider directory?
+ If fold is not found then part of .mws file is deleted.

+ Do better syntax checking on fold properties.
+ Have Piper console use the text area font size (like svn does).
- Include Piper documentation in Piper plugin.

+ Macro: right click menu which allows inserting of fold template.
+ Place MathRider variables in standard jEdit beanshell environment.
+ Use the ContextMenu plugin to create a special popup menu for .mws files.
+ Add dock sidekick plugin to the right side of the screen and have it show outline of .mws files.
+ "If none of the predicates are true, the function is returned with its arguments evaluated." Should "evaluated" be "unevaluated" here? (section 1.5 of the programmer's manual.
+ Use ShortCutSaver plugin for .mws shortcut keys (maybe like <shift><enter>).

		}
+ Allow folds to call other folds.
+ Allow GUI components to call folds.
+ Add uasm65 mode.

shouldn't n be replaced with k?
The following example with z instead of k works:

-the following problem kept me busy the entire last day: When comparing the log-files
from the tests with older test runs, the file sums.pit produced strange results.
First, I thought I overlooked the problem in the past and repeated tests along the
version history since I moved from yacas to piper, but the real problem is that the
output depends on which tests run before that script.
I did not dig deeper into the problem, but maybe one of the other test scripts
changes part of the rule base or it is a bug in Yacas. So the result of the
tests depends on the order of the scripts in the diectory, which is random.
A remedy in oder to have repeatable tests is to recreate the PiperInterpreter
for each run of the tests.

(2^x)^3 evaluates to 2^x^3. compare to (say) gnu calc, which evaluates
this to 2^(3x). note that yacas evaluates (x^2)^3 to x^6.

apologies if this is is a well-known bug (or if instead it is
considered a feature)

More Yacas bugs:

* Simplify(0.0000001) returns 1

 * Simplify(0.00000000001) returns Undefined

 * TrigSimpCombine(0.0000001) returns 1

Any ideas for a temporary workaround appreciated  - I've tried adding "+1-1" and "+0*x" onto the end...

thanks,

Mike

Possible bugs:

1) Solve(x==x^3,x) produces several "MathSqrt: invalid argument: -1"
messages.

2) I don't think the prettyprint version of Solve(x==x^3,x) is correct
(seems to start with sqrt[3] which isn't in the regular version (see 2nd and
3rd screenshots attached))

3) If you try and simplify the answers to Solve(x==x^3,x), you get some odd
results. The first screenshot (attached) has the input and output to
Simplify shown.

cheers,

Mike

Here are some Yacas bugs we've noticed whilst developing GeoGebra:

* Factor(a^2 - b^2) returns FWatom(a^2 - b^2)

Also do you know if Yacas can simplify exp(x) - 1/exp(-x)?

+Note: the variable names "foreach..." have been chosen so they won't get confused with normal variables you use. This is a major design flaw in this language. Suppose there was a local variable foreachitem, defined in the calling function, and used in foreachbody. These two would collide, and the interpreter would use only the last defined version. In general, when writing a function that calls Eval(), it is a good idea to use variable names that can not collide with user's variables. This is generally the single largest cause of bugs when writing programs in Piper. This issue should be addressed in the future.

----
+ Regular expressions
The regular expressions plugin
This plugin allows for text processing using regular expressions. The GPL'ed package pcre is included for this purpose (pcre stands for Perl compatible regular expressions).

To use the plugin, the plugin has to be loaded through:

Use("pcre");

The pcre plugin offers two principal functions: PcreLexer and PcreNextToken. PcreLexer sets up and initializes the tokenizer to scan for a set of regular expressions. A call to PcreNextToken returns the result of the scan in the current file, starting from the current position.

PcreLexer does not interfere with normal reading of a file. When normal read calls are made, the default tokenizer is used. The tokenizer set up by PcreLexer is only used when PcreNextToken is called.

The syntax for PcreLexer is:

PcreLexer(tokens);

The argument tokens is a list of token definitions. A token definition in turn is a list, with the first element a string containing the regular expression, and the second containing an atom that can describe the type of the token (for easy recognition later).

Calling PcreNextToken() will then return the first matching token from the current input.

The following example sets up the tokenizer to recognize either an integer, or a word consisting only of lowercase letters.

In> DllLoad("pcre")
Out> True
In> PcreLexer({{"[0-9]+",Integer},{"[a-z]+",Word}})
Out> True
In> FromString("123abc")PcreNextToken()
Out> {"123",Integer}
In> FromString("===abc")PcreNextToken()
Out> {"abc",Word}

From Axel:
In the refactored sources I've tried to:
* use generic HashMap<...,...> there possible instead of Hashtable and
eliminated some Hashtable wrapper classes
* use equals() method instead of "==" "!=" operator for Strings, but
there is still a problem, because I didn't get rid of the (new)
StringUtil.intern() method!

IMO also the package structure should be refactored to easier maintain
the piper API
* all PiperEvaluator based classes should go in their own package and
not be included as MathCommand subclasses.
* the parser classes should be in an own package
* the LispObject based classes should go in their own package
* the SBox based classes should go in their own package and not be
included as SBoxBuilder subclasses.

Subject: Calling Clojure from Java (Shortcuts)
Reply | Reply to author | Forward | Print | Individual message | Show original | Report this message | Find messages by this author
Hello,

Evaluating arbitrary Clojure code from Java seems to be a common
stumbling block, so I put together a simple utility to wrap the
process. Please let me know if the attached code is a reasonable way
to do this.

One issue is that the callers of runClosureScript() all share and
modify the same lexical environment. Is it possible to prevent this?

Cheers,

Having a single environment is an intentional design decision,
primarily to ensure efficient operation.  I asked this same question
some time ago, in the context of comparing Clojure to SISC, which has
a Runtime class that you can create and therefore use to have multiple
execution environments within the same JVM.  Rich's response was:

"[Clojure is designed that way] for speed. Multiple runtimes means
reified environments and a runtime lookup for every var reference.
Clojure var references get compiled into fns as static members and
looked up once only during load."

FWIW, I did some very informal benchmarking of SISC vs. Clojure in
January, and Clojure was easily two orders of magnitude faster.  I'd
say I was equally unskilled in both environments at the time, so maybe
there's some tricks to be had in SISC-land that would have helped
some.  Regardless, the upshot of those results were/are hard to argue
with, at least for me.

It seems most people are having problems either:

 With a runtime error in code entered in the repl (or sent from an
editor buffer), rather than loaded, where there are no relevant source
line numbers to use.

{{{ U6502
+ Change PrintMess to PrintString in monitor and books.
+ If a label is placed in the operation column, an exception is thrown.
- Add reset method to IOChip interface.
+ This line should cause an error in the assembler but it doesn't: "sum	dbt d". Notice it is missing a value before d.
+ Branching to addresses throws a "string out of bounds" exception in a uasm65 fold.
+ Make ROM read only in the emulator.
+ Enter Copy button and popup menu to U6502.
+ Make an ASCII chart plugin.
- sumlist program does not place sum dwd ? 00's into .s19 file.
+ On a similar note, what do you want/expect to happen when a user tries
 to trace through a program (as I did!) which calls Monitor subroutines.
 What I found in my case was that it traced through the jump table and
then hung.
