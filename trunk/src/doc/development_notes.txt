Development notes.

:indentSize=4:lineSeparator=\n:noTabs=false:tabSize=4:folding=explicit:collapseFolds=1:wordWrap=soft:

{{{====To Do
+ Add default fold which will set default fold properties like output="output".
+ Add dependency code for geogebra, errorlist, etc.
+ Add output property for folds.
+ Add shortcut and button for inserting a fold into a .mrn file.
+ Allow properties to not use quotes around the value.
+ Change Geogebra to GeoGebra globally.
+ Change file format from .mrn to .mathrider (maybe leave .mrn to make tabs shorter.) (Actually, perhaps .mr or .mar would be better.).
+ Check if Yacas remembers variable values between sessions.
+ Check to make sure that at least Sun's Java 5 is installed.
+ Do better syntax checking on fold properties.
+ Have Yacas console use the text area font size (like svn does).
+ Include Yacas documentation in JYacas plugin.
+ Make the JYacas console the default console application.
+ Obtain line number when JYacas encounters an error when executing a file.
+ Perhaps run JYacas in its own thread so that the application does not lock up during execution.
+ Register a single error source instance and make it accessible to the <shift><click> macro.
+ Why doesn't =, :=, etc. highlight?
+ Macro which brings up checkbox for all properties for a % fold command when it is shift clicked.
+ Macro: right click menu which allows inserting of fold template.
+ Place MathRider variables in standard jEdit beanshell environment.
+ Use the ContextMenu plugin to create a special popup menu for .mrn files.
+ Add dock sidekick plugin to the right side of the screen and have it show outline of .mrn files.
+ Use ShortCutSaver plugin for .mrn shortcut keys (maybe like <shift><enter>.
+ Study TextAutocomplete plugin for ideas on keyword autocompletion.
- Fix problem where %output folds don't cause extra %ends but %error folds do.
+ Figure out a way to output the result of the last expression in a fold without Writing or Echoing.
+ Implement symbolic arithmetic so that m := 144 == 20 * a + b; n := 136 == 10 * a + b;c := m-n; works.
+ Make fold types a property for use by Shift_Enter.bsh file, mode file, and the configurable fold handler plugin.
+ Allow help on a Yacas function to be brought up by ???ing on it (including the source code of the function).
+ Check to see if we can remove the C: stripping code from Shift_Enter.bsh with this: file:///C:/ted/download/yacas_manual/refchapter26.html#c26".
- Add quotes to mode.
- Add usage information to the JYacas console.
- Change // and /**/ to same color in mode.
- Fix GeoGebra docking menu overwriting problem.
- Make a JYacas mode file.
- Perhaps add properties to a fold like manipulate=true:output=latex.
- Tag folds by type, for example %yacas, %latex, %uasm65, %equation.

Initial release:
+ Documentation: Main mathrider, all plugins.
+ Add GPL statement to all source code files.
+ Check GPL statements on plugins.

{{{Fold types (Make sure to add fold types in Shift_Enter.bsh file, mode file and configurable fold handler plugin.)
+ yacas - Executes yacas code.
+ cas - Executes code using the default cas system.
+ manipulate - Allows user to manipulate an equation or inequality.
+ latex - Displays latex code using the default latex viewer.
+ geogebra - Sends geogebra commands to geogebra.
+ plot2d - Plots functions using the default 2d plotting program.
+ jmol - Sends jmol commands to jmol.
+ plot3d - Plots functions using the default 3d plotting program.
+ spreadsheet - Sends spreadsheet data to the default spreadsheet program.
+ beanshell - Sends code to beanshell.  Useful for creating GUIs, text scripts, etc.
+ html.
+ sql.
+ buffer - Code is held in a separate buffer.  May be useful for large blocks of code.

{{{Yacas bugs.
+ Why do some commands return True: while others return True with no : (Like Function);
+ What is FWatom in the factors.rep repository?
+ PrettyPrinter'Set: TexForm should be TeXForm.
===

//What prime factors do the numbers 21, 42, and 56 have in common.
a := {};
a := Append(a,Factors(21));
a := Append(a,Factors(42));
a := Append(a,Factors(56));

//a := Flatten(a);
Echo(a);

     {{{%output 
      {{3,1},{7,1}} {{2,1},{3,1},{7,1}} {{2,3},{7,1}}

Why is this list missing commas and curly braces?

{{{Yacas enhancements.
+Multivariate factoring.

{{{Yacas questions.
+ How does one expand 2^3 into 2*2*2?

{{{====Determining if an error was encountered.

String response = yacas.Evaluate(expression);

if (yacas.iError != null)
{

{{{===="Notebook" thoughts.

One could create a html-based notebook like the Sage notebook but perhaps it would be better to create a 100% Applet-based notebook which would use a layout manager to lay components out in a vertical fasion.  The mathrider application can generate online notebooks which is similar to the way that GeoGebra generates online viewers.
}}}

{{{====Calculator thoughts.
- Include multiple calculator plugins and create a way for them to interoperate with JYacas.
