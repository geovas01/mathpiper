#Miscellaneous information about JReduce.

== Make commands ==


make jlisp.jar
  Make just the lisp system.
         
make jlisp.img
  Makes jlisp.img, and then
  java -jar jlisp.jar -i jlisp.img
  should run JUST a Lisp system. Small and simple for testing?
  
make reduce.img 
     and then
java -jar jlisp.jar -i reduce.img
     should run Reduce. The "-w" option decides if it should try
     to create its own window or run as a console mode app.

make reduce.jar
  Makes the lisp interpreter plus reduce.img and packages them into reduce.jar.

make minireduce.jar
  Makes the lisp interpreter plus a small version of the RLisp scripts.


== Removing RLisp libraries ==

To follow this up - to make a custom cut-down version you would edit trunk/packages/package.map and comment out some of the lines that mention modules not tagged a "core".  If would then be up to you to ensure you did not keep a package but remove something it depended on, and the term "core" is more because those things are needed in order to build the rest than because other bits are frivolous...
