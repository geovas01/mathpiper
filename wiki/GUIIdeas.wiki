#summary Miscellaneous ideas which are related to MathPiper's graphical user interface.

From Frans Morville (Oct 17, 2010):

There is a thing I have been wanting, and maybe it is included in your
plans:

As output after an input "In> ..."
you can now get a "Result: "  nicely formatted and you can get some
text as "Side Effects:  ...  using Echo in the program.

It would be nice, if you could have mixtures of text and formatted
formulas in the "Side Effects".  E.g. One line of text, one line with a formula, two lines of text, one formula etc. Using Prettyform, you get it, but without the nice Latex formatting.
